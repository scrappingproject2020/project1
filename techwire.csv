SMIC also works with US firms including Qualcomm, Broadcom, and Texas Instruments, among others.The United States trade clash has so far put a shadow over Huawei’s survival and has pushed ByteDance towards a forced sale of the US arm of social media app TikTok.Beijing has announced it is “firmly opposed” to any such action against SMIC and has accused Washington of fabricating national security concerns to break international trade rules.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian accused the US of “blatant bullying” and urged it to stop “over-stretching the concept of national security to oppress foreign companies.”SMIC operates five chip-making plants in China, and can reportedly create nearly half a million wafers a month. But analysts believe that a US trade ban could threaten its existence, and stall China’s own ambitious technological growth.“If implemented, this will severely undermine SMIC’s ability to advance technologies,” Bernstein analysts said. “As US equipment is indispensable for advanced semiconductor R&D and production, such a restriction, once implemented, effectively allows the US government to decide how fast, or slow, SMIC’s technology progress would be.”With the US accounting for as much as Huawei has been ",The US could ban China’s biggest chipmaker next,https://techwireasia.com/2020/09/the-us-could-ban-chinas-biggest-chipmaker-next/,8 September 2020

At the same time, there is still huge value for hackers in targeting large companies and smaller enterprises should not get let their vigilance slip.“Our industry has been unfaltering in our advanced research and resolute reporting of sophisticated attacks and we see its important contribution in the weakening of some ransomware campaigns. But we can never be complacent. Prolific attacks may always fly under our radar and we need to continue to watch out for them,” says Yeo Siang Tiong, General Manager for Southeast Asia at Kaspersky.“The spray and pray tactic of ransomware creators may be over but we are also observing the rise of the more dangerous targeted ransomware. It is good news that ransomware detections against SMBs in the region have become lesser in quantity, but the recent headline-grabbing incidents involving Maze ransomware and the recent WastedLocker attack which allegedly earned $10 million in one infection should be a clear reminder for all companies, however small, that we need to beef up our cybersecurity now more than ever against this costly threat,” Yeo adds.If your organization has become a victim of a ransomware attack, Kaspersky recommends disconnecting the infected computer from any network and the internet and then isolate it. And never pay the ransom demanded by the cybercriminals.As in a real-life hostage situation, it’s best not to negotiate with cyber attackers. Paying the ransom is not a guarantee that the compromised data will be returned and yielding encourages this sort of crime, the cybersecurity company said.","Good news, ransomware targeting SMEs is on the decline in SEA",https://techwireasia.com/2020/09/good-news-ransomware-targeting-smes-is-on-the-decline-in-sea/,7 September 2020

Taiwan’s most prolific manufacturer, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), recently severed its long-running ties with China’s 5G equipment market leader Huawei Technologies, following fresh American trade restrictions that explicitly prohibit the US and its allies from supplying Huawei with valuable tech components.TSMC’s decision to discontinue its Huawei relationship, combined with its“We would call these American values.

Like the enterprise, we imagine urban spaces can be outfitted with new, advanced technology — When 5G arrives, offering speeds up to 100x faster than our current 4G, the journey to realizing smart city potential will be massively accelerated. Offering faster connections, better reliability, and greater capacity, 5G will connect infrastructure, devices, and people with more efficiency. It will serve as the backbone technology to new high-bandwidth, low-latency applications, supporting things like vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology, and personalized services that leverage real-time data.But for 100 smart city experts, surveyed by Fotech, smart cities should be taking advantage more of existing technologies and infrastructure, rather than waiting for the roll-out of new tech like 5G. Four out of five respondents (80%) claimed to be more likely to invest in a smart city project based on existing infrastructure rather than one requiring the installation of new technology.While we could be quick to dispel the findings as a result of concerns over the expense of new technological infrastructure, cost of deployment was considered a barrier by just over a third (35%), while data privacy concerns were the main issue among nearly a half (49%).According to Fobar, this is an indication that while enhancing the ‘data view’ of cities is essential to providing the insight needed to meet the demands of urbanization and societal changes, the assumption that entirely new infrastructure will be at the heart of these systems may be false.Chris Shannon, CEO of Fotech Solutions, said the findings “highlight the need for more practical approaches to creating smart city systems – using innovation to extract more value from infrastructure that has already been expensively installed.”He continued: “Avoiding the cost and disruption of rolling out new technologies and capitalizing on existing infrastructure – such as fiber optic networks and 4G technology for example – could have huge benefits for cities around the world and significantly shorten the ‘time to value’ for smart city projects.”Smart cities are less about piling new technology into our urban spaces, as though installing a Google Home system into a 200-year-old mansion. The concept is really about making the existing environment work better for its citizens, making cities more sustainable, and improving residents’ quality of life — that means that if the technology works for Copenhagen, it won’t, by default, work for Rio de Janeiro.Technology is only as significant as the positive difference it makes on people’s lives. In TechHQThrough a focus on smart solutions integration, digital technologies, services, and social innovation, Planet’s core aim is to enhance the quality of life experienced by residents and to do so the firm employs technology that varies dramatically from community to community.“Our unique model sees us factor in the needs and wants of each local community […],” Chief Digital Strategy, Alan Marcus explained. “In Smart City Laguna, we have introduced solutions such as a library of things, free communal Wi-Fi, shared, public spaces, and an innovation hub, developed to provide a foundation for shared living and host free educational courses for residents and the surrounding community.”Marcus continued: “Our smart solutions aren’t always super-advanced futuristic solutions but actually looking at ways we can use these technologies smarter to improve the lives of all of our residents.”COULD THE PANDEMIC AFFECT OUR PERSPECTIVE ON SMART CITIES?The firm strives to “introduce new processes and programs that lead to a change in daily routines, in resource abilities, relationships or values of the community.” It is such a foundation that can drive more rounded success in the field of PropTech, with businesses and developers able to “utilize technology to build efficiency within those processes”. For example, utilizing smart meters and energy efficiency programs to change the relationship residents have with energy usage, or a neighborhood watch program utilizing CCTV.So, while the term ‘smart cities’ might conjure visions of cool, clean urban space enriched with advanced new technologies, at its core, the concept is about simply being smarter with the technology already in place.","Smart cities don’t need 5G, they just need smart thinking",https://techwireasia.com/2020/09/smart-cities-dont-need-5g-they-just-need-smart-thinking/,9 September 2020
