That marks a significant departure from a production process that has served as a competitive differentiator for around 50 years, and comes as the firm begins to lose its grip on the In the conference call that saw Intel’s share price dip by 18% Friday, Swan told analysts that Intel would be prepared to “use somebody else’s process technology” as part of “contingency plans”.“That gives us much more optionality and flexibility. So in the event there is a process slip, we can try something rather than make it all ourselves,” he said.The statement followed confirmation of delays to production processes, that will see the roll-out of its 7-nanometer chip technology backed up by a year, probably more. Intel’s current best technology – 10-nanometer – was supposed to appear in 2017, but is only just creaking its way into wide scale production now.If production of 7-nanometer chips is delayed by 1 – 2 years, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) and Samsung would already be fabricating 5-nanometer chops, with higher density and lower energy use.However, since Swan’s words, Taiwan’s TSMC focuses on production alone, and its factories now outperform Intel’s, allowing more direct rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) to catch up with Intel on performance.And while TSMC is already providing the likely choice, Intel will be competing with TSMC’s own customers for attention, includingIntel’s announcement – pretty simply, that it’s struggling to produce chips, and the technology it’s working with is already obsolete compared to Asian market rivals – calls into question the United States’ efforts to bring critical manufacturing back to the country, including successful lobbying by US semiconductor technology companies themselves to secure subsidies for chip production on home soil.Two days before Swan’s announcement, the US House of Representatives passed an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act providing federal subsidies for semiconductor manufacturing.On the amendment, the Semiconductor Industry Association said: “Congress has a strategic opportunity to strengthen US semiconductor manufacturing and research, two crucial drivers of America’s economic strength, national security, and supply chain resilience. Today’s votes are important steps in the right direction and show there is broad, bipartisan support in Congress for bold semiconductor manufacturing incentives and research investments.”Days after Swan said Intel’s plants were not currently up to the task, Intel cut loose chief engineering officer Murthy Renduchintala, the executive in charge of its chip design and manufacturing operations. A statement read that changes were to “accelerate product leadership and improve focus and accountability in process technology execution.”Renduchintala was poached from Qualcomm in February 2016 and put in charge of design, engineering and manufacturing of Intel’s chips, under the firm’s Technology, Systems Architecture and Client Group. That arm will now be split up into multiple teams, all reporting directly to Swan.",Intel outsourcing – US chip stalwart looks to Asian firms for help,https://techwireasia.com/2020/07/intel-outsourcing-us-chip-stalwart-looks-to-asian-firms-for-help/,29 July 2020

In fact, the continent accounts for six out of the top 10 most congested cities in the latest year ranking by Dutch location tech specialists In the Indian capital of Delhi, drivers in the sprawling metropolis spend as much as 58% more time stuck in traffic compared to drivers in any other city in the world. With the problem only getting worse, city officials have been determined to find a workable solution. That quest led them to a new intelligent traffic management system driven by Intelligent traffic management systems refer to the usage of AI, machine learning, computer vision, sensors, and data analysis tools to collect and analyze traffic data, generate solutions, and apply them to the traffic infrastructure.In Delhi, over 7,500 CCTV cameras, automated traffic lights, and one thousand LED signs carry sensors and cameras that are compiling real-time data on traffic conditions, which the AI processes into Alibaba’s City Brain is perhaps one of the most widely-distributed intelligent traffic management systems in Asia. The AI-powered system is already in deployment in 23 cities in China, as well as in other countries such as Malaysia. Gathering data such as video from intersection cameras and GPS data on the location of cars and buses, the platform crunches information in real-time and coordinates more than 1,000 road signals around the city with the aim of preventing or easing gridlock.In Hangzhou, Alibaba’s base, the thriving metropolis of 7 million people was once ranked fifth among China’s most congested cities but has now dropped to 57th on the list.Speaking to CNN, the company says that after two years of testing, the system appears to have shortened commutes and also helped first respondents by enabling fire trucks and ambulances to halve the amount of time it takes to respond to emergencies.“The cities in China are probably facing more challenges than any other city,” said Wang Jian, chairman of Alibaba’s technology steering committee, who said the technology could pave the way for other smart city applications.Municipalities with smart city aspirations are increasingly turning to AI-driven traffic solutions like this. Saudi Arabia, for instance, has a stated aim to transform into a smart nation as part of its Vision 2030 initiative. One of its major industrial hubs, Yanbu Industrial City, began integrating the AI-powered intelligent traffic management systems from Huawei, which now comprises over 250 high-definition cameras working at 16 major road intersections, supplying high-quality images and videos that feed data for officials to take immediate or planned actions.The Intelligent Traffic Management System (ITMS) pushes AI to the fore, running smart algorithms to automatically identify traffic violations including running red lights, crossing lanes, reverse driving, and lane marking infractions, among others. The response is much faster, running about 100,000 data records and capable of receiving a response within seconds.In addition to improving traffic conditions, ITMS also contributes towards Traffic management systems help to manage traffic and avoid accidents on the road, but they will also enable the traffic-choked cities in Asia to be more prepared to adopt autonomous vehicles which have a significantly less environmental footprint.What’s more, the power of AI that propels a lot of the data analysis of these systems, is also what powers the navigation systems of ride-hailing as well as last-mile delivery operators. Deliveries or order fulfillments that had to be delayed in the past, can now be enhanced significantly as cities around Asia continue taking up such intelligent traffic systems.",AI-powered traffic management is slashing Asia’s congestion problem,https://techwireasia.com/2020/08/ai-powered-traffic-management-is-slashing-asias-congestion-problem/,28 August 2020

Cybercriminals were lightning fast to emerge and capitalize on the crisis and confusion.Cybersecurity is a complex beast. Despite the inch-thick, Teflon-coated plate we place around the IT network, it only takes one hasty click of a rogue phishing link to open a backdoor for cybercriminals to take control.While malware may become more sophisticated and the methods of attackers harder to detect, at present we are playing against a familiar if unrelenting foe; the age of quantum computing will bring a force of adversity of new proportions.“You might think that 2020 has been a rough year for cybersecurity, but we’re only just scratching the surface of what could go wrong,” Dr Ali El Kaafarani, founder of “Add quantum computers into the mix, and the entire foundation of today’s information security will be under threat.”Hard to fathom though it is today, few disagree that quantum computing will be a revolutionary technology.Heading towards a market worth of US$5.8 billion by 2025, every few months we hear of “Quantum computing is the future industry and infrastructure disruptor for organizations looking to use large amounts of data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to accelerate real-time business intelligence and innovate product development,” according to Heather Wells, the IDC’s senior research analyst of Infrastructure Systems, Platforms, and Technology.Theoretical use cases of the technology span anything concerning large, uncertain systems that need to be simulated, from predicting the financial markets to producing better, cheaper drugs.But as the quantum dawn approaches, conventions challenged include our notions of how we can protect our machines and networks — which, as we know, are regularly proven to be far from airtight. Of particular concern is quantum computing’s potential to eventually break encryption methods, which are used in varying degrees to safeguard data from individual to state level.“The scale of the quantum threat cannot be underestimated,” said Kaafarani. They will have the ability to smash through traditional public-key encryption, threatening the security of all sensitive information, past and present.“Data across cars, planes, medical devices, servers, and countless other devices cannot be secured retrospectively; they must be protected now.”The threat is too severe to ignore, but it’s not being overlooked. In fact, the US National Security AgencyThat process is now in theThe quantum computing cybersecurity threat comes down to the ease of which the technology will likely be able to break through existing methods of encryption. Existing types of encryption revolve around mathematical problems, such as integer factorization and discrete logarithm, which are difficult for classic machines to solve because of their computational limitations. But once quantum computers arrive, they will be able to easily solve those mathematical problems and thus break the most common form of modern encryption — public-key cryptography.“Our team is designing new post-quantum cryptographic solutions for software, hardware, and communications, which go way beyond those encryption methods, using different mathematical fields and principles that offer the complexity necessary to stump even a quantum computer,” said Kaafarani.He added confidence that there are no algorithms that can solve the type of mathematical problems that PQShield is using to build the next generation of public-key cryptography.Quantum computing advances have been incremental to date, but Kaafarani believes there have been notable advances in the last few years that have raise alarm bells for those looking at the application of the technology “as a weapon”.In late 2019, we started to see back and forth between Google and IBM about achieving ‘quantum supremacy’ when it came to performing certain calculations and then we saw the“At this current pace of innovation, it’s not unfeasible that we could see a nation-state or well-capitalized company develop a rudimentary quantum computer within the next decade. We might not know about it, it would be a huge competitive advantage and they might choose to keep it secret,” Kaafarani said.“While different industries have different timelines depending on how long their product life cycles are, it’s fair to say that for data across cars, planes, military vehicles, power stations, satellites, IoT – anything that will last over 10 years — this threat needs to be considered right now.”While with current computers, we lack the practical means to do so due to computational and memory limitations to do so, a malicious actor using a quantum computer could gain access to the secret key corresponding to any public key.An attacker could use that access to forge the signature of a software update and push an update to, say, an engine part and it will not know it’s forged, Kaafarani explained: “This would then enable the bad actor to alter the operations of an aircraft through that part as they wish in secret. That’s also what makes the famous ‘harvest now decrypt later’ attack possible.”It is then vital to act now to ensure a smooth yet secure transition into the powerful quantum era.",The quantum computing cybersecurity threat ‘cannot be underestimated’,https://techwireasia.com/2020/09/the-quantum-computing-cybersecurity-threat-cannot-be-underestimated/,3 September 2020

The country is primed for a When it comes to the wider Southeast Asian region, Since its inception around four years ago, Akulaku has been creating virtual finance products for the A realization by company founder William Li on the broader potential within Southeast Asia set the burgeoning fintech firm on a new path: “As our market experience deepened, we realized there was huge income disparity in Southeast Asia,” “While many young people make US$283 a month, we also find a sizeable middle-class segment that makes more than USD$1,415. There is strong demand for wealth management among these high-income individuals,” he added.Since 2019, Akulaku has quickly advanced its online wealth management platform, which has more than 100,000 monthly active users in Indonesia. The high cost of consumer banking in Indonesia has caused a large, unfulfilled space that digital banking operations like Akulaku are now occupying, and the firm is capitalizing on the potential in the rest of Southeast Asia.“The potential for digital banking in Southeast Asia is enormous,” observed Li. “Just in personal banking alone, we are looking at 400 million workers. Only 5 to 10% are using digital banking services, so we have 300 million potential customers.”Akulaku has already expanded into the Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia, with over 6 million users in total and an annual transaction value of over US$1.5 billion. For the next stage of its growth trajectory, the fintech will be relying heavily on technology as it looks to overcome additional risks, like increased loan defaulters, amid the response to the ongoing pandemic.Akulaku scaled back its online lending operations due to the pandemic, while its risk control system driven by artificial intelligence (AI) helped to navigate the murky loan approvals process. Li says AI in risk control is a frequent topic he discusses with regional banks and financial institutes.“They asked if we could assist with technical and risk control solutions,” he elaborated. “Coincidentally, we have incubated our existing risk control systems and models into service outputs, which can be released as ready-made financial technology products.”COVID-19 might have pushed back its targets momentarily, but Akulaku’s long-term goals are still intact: The company wants to harness AI and machine algorithms to solve accelerate digital banking needs in the region, including services in online account transfers, Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and risk assessment protocols, and even anti-fraud and anti-money laundering processes.“Suppose you have 10 million customers. Each customer performs two transactions every month, totaling 20 million transactions per month,” Li calculates. “Every transaction involves risk control, KYC, and anti-fraud– such calculations are simply beyond human capacity. We must rely on technology, which is why our investment in research and development exceeds USD 28million every year.”With the reliance on cutting-edge risk and financial tech, Akulaku hopes to serve upwards of 50 million customers by 2025, and to continue growing its digital banking presence to at least ten markets in the next five years.",Indonesia’s Akulaku rides the digital banking wave in Southeast Asia,https://techwireasia.com/2020/07/indonesias-akulaku-rides-the-digital-banking-wave-in-southeast-asia/,17 July 2020

Alibaba-owned Ant, for instance, scrutinizes This is in stark contrast with the traditional banking sector, where usually the financial institution is extending credit based on the available collateral, and credit-lending facilities are limited by the user’s existing, available credit data, thereby ruling out around 2 billion people globally without bank histories from participating, and contributing, towards the local economy.“Their access to big data is not the only potential advantage for big techs over banks,” the BIS said in a With micro-lending and credit availability from fintech firms around Asia set to increase, the provision of such financial services could help SMBs to secure stabilized financing, particularly for those smaller -companies which might struggle to get a traditional bank loan.In addition, the BIS whitepaper found that the looser regulatory framework around credit from the big tech giants of Asia means that SMBs are able to secure a larger supply of credit. Virtual credit facilities also do not become pricier as the market becomes more volatile, which does happen with traditional bank credit.“The tech giants control such an enormous part of our lives online, financial services could be one of those things that could make sense for them to offer,” “They certainly have the necessary ingredients to make good investment decisions, such as massive amounts of data, artificial intelligence capabilities, and smart people,” added Thusith Mahanama, the co-founder and CEO of the Boston-based client reporting services provider Assette LLC.",How Asia’s fintechs are upending traditional loans,https://techwireasia.com/2020/09/how-big-techs-data-driven-approach-to-credit-could-steady-smes/,8 September 2020

The players that embrace this technology successfully are poised to pull far ahead of laggards as they realize new data-powered, personalized experiences for a widening band of millennial and Gen Z customers.But what will 5G really offer in the fintech space, beyond what’s currently made possible by 3G and 4G?“4G technology is increasingly unable to handle the load efficiently, which hampers timely transactions and trading,” Prof. Wong Kam Fai, Associate Dean (External Affairs) of the Faculty of Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong told “The amount of global financial activity has increased rapidly in the last few years. This in turn has led to a growing volume of financial data, which includes not only numerical data but also other forms such as location, audio, video and the like.”The potential of 5G in fintech lies in the razor-thin latency offered by the technology. This refers to the time it takes for a device to send a command to a remote server and get a reply. With 5G, latency is expected to be slashed from 50 milliseconds currently offered by 4G to under 1 millisecond.This will make banking staples – like payments and transactions – instant. It will allow for quicker but much more robust security features.

However, unlike more notable CBDCs currently being carried out by other governments such as China’s Digital Yuan project, Project Bakong is not a natively-digital currency.Instead, users need to load Khmer Riel into their Bakong accounts, to be exchanged in transactions over the system. NBC instead hopes that Bakong will give competition to the usage of the US dollar that is so prevalent, and make the local economy less reliant on the dollar.With the support of 11 banks already with more expected to join, the whitepaper says Project Bakong looks to allow the economy to transition to a real-time funds transfer system instead, including allowing interbank transfers. As the whitepaper states, “The implementation of Bakong would connect all financial institutions and payment service providers under a single payment platform which will allow for fund transfers to be processed on a real-time basis without the need of a centralized clearinghouse.”In addition, Bakong will also serve as a peer-to-peer (P2P) platform including retail payments and a variety of transaction types. The system will leverage QR technology on mobile-based platforms, making it easier to access for Cambodians. The NBC claims that Bakong’s P2P nature eliminates a lot of the inefficiencies of the centralized clearinghouse models, without costing users anything to transact.Cambodia has a demographically young and increasingly tech-savvy population, according to the paper, and financial transactions are being carried out electronically more than ever, with e-wallet accounts in the country increasing by a massive 64% in 2019 to a record 5.22 million accounts.The NBC refers to Project Bakong in the whitepaper as a blockchain payments system as opposed to a CBDC, and says that more developed nations are looking to CBDCs to deal with their population’s lessening use of cash. The central bank contends that for developing countries like Cambodia, a national digital payment system can promote financial inclusion to various levels of society including those below the poverty line, while also helping to improve upon scattered inefficient payment systems.",Is Cambodia introducing a blockchain-based digital currency?,https://techwireasia.com/2020/07/is-cambodia-introducing-a-blockchain-based-digital-currency/,1 July 2020

These fraudulent clicks or ‘conversions’ are Chad Andrews, the global solutions leader for advertising and blockchain at IBM, told “Advertisers and their agencies need to deliver digital ads across many thousands of media properties, culminating in millions or even billions of delivered impressions. To achieve this at scale, a vast, complex technology ecosystem of intermediaries is needed,” explained Andrews, citing the demand and supply side, data management platforms as well as online, real-time bidding exchanges as some of the intermediaries who make use of their own data sources to spot, mark up, buy, and resell digital ad inventory.Andrews pointed out that perhaps even more so than other supply chain issues it might be used in, distributed ledger or “Blockchain’s unique ability to serve as a decentralized, neutral ledger for all fees and summary ad fulfillment data, as well as a Not only would a distributed ledger framework provide clear, unfettered recognition of all the stakeholders and intermediaries that link within a given digital ad ecosystem, but it would also add identity verification value: any stakeholder with authorized access would be able to monitor and check the stored data.Ad data on-platform tends to have many variable terms, such as time data, agencies involved, geolocation data and ad platform information– creating a whole mess of data that is not fixed and capable to be confused by ad bots creating fake impressions, which could be exploited by fraudsters. “For the first time, blockchain makes it conceivable that advertisers will only pay for what can be verified at time of delivery to be quality, authentic impressions,” Andrews said.The technology now exists where the data on the blockchain could be ‘fixed’ or immutable, meaning the data cannot be altered once it is recorded on the blockchain. This could add an additional layer of security and work well for earnings audits, but when records need to be updated constantly, a solution like A smart contract is a binding digital agreement between two parties that is securely recorded on the blockchain. The network is able to store billions of points of data. “Television ad impressions can reach about 3 hundred billion impressions per month.

While we enjoy more choice and variety than ever as consumers today, we have never been further from the original source of our food supply. With this complexity comes risk. At the same time, consumers are becoming conscious of the environmental and societal impact their food has in its original locale, and want assurances that producers are honoring ethical commitments. In short, producers are being held to higher standards of transparency than ever before. Established over 150 years ago, Nestlé is the biggest food manufacturer in the world. In 2019, the Swiss headquartered giant sold Essentially a pillar of the world’s supermarket supply chain, then, this market-leader is held to yet higher standards than most.The Swiss food giant is investing significant resources into innovations that make tracking a product’s journey as simple, easy and standardized as flipping a bag of chips and checking its ingredients. Blockchain is one such technology that’s helping it do so. Over the course of several years to date, Nestlé has made considerable progress in unearthing blockchain’s potential. The group is a founding member of the Last year, Nestlé Benjamin Dubois“We have looked at other legacy technologies to do the same thing […] the problem we had is that there is no technology that was flexible enough, that had the level of trust and immutability.” Outside of the As a result, most companies have only limited visibility and insight into where all their products are at any given moment. With blockchain, companies can own a real-time and immutable digital ledger of transactions and movements for all participants in their supply chain network. The structure of the technology ensures that each player along the food value chain would generate and securely share data points, with labels that clarify ownership, creating an accountable and traceable system that no other technology can match. “Blockchain is a decentralized solution,” said Dubois. “It’s about creating this independent and auditable flow of data along our value chain – every actor has the responsibility to upload the data […] we are responsible for our parts; we can convey that to the consumer and they can be assured of the genuineness of what they see.“The consumer knows that the data uploaded by the farmer has not been subsequently changed by someone else,” Dubois continued. “We can consolidate the data we have in silos, and show it to the consumer so that they can make their own judgement.”While many companies, including US retail and Palm oil, a common ingredient in food today, is responsible for huge amounts of deforestation across the planet. While In efforts to crackdown on illegal and unsustainable fishing practices, meanwhile, World Wildlife Fund (WWF), and tech companies ConsenSys and TraSeable have deployed a blockchain partnership in the Pacific Islands tuna industry that will use blockchain technology to track the journey of tuna from This April, Nestlé used blockchain to track the origin of its luxury coffee brand Zoégas, a blend made from arabica coffee beans from Brazil, Rwanda and Colombia and roasted in Sweden. By scanning a QR code, buyers can access blockchain-recorded data including information about the coffee’s separate origins, its farmers, time of harvest, transaction certificate for the specific shipments, as well as the roasting period. The coffee, and the process behind its production, is fully-certified by the Rainforest Alliance. There is now an incredibly complex “conveyor belt of data” available from our food supply chains, said Dubois – all of which when woven together provides rich insight into the journey of our food. While Nestlé, and other members of the food industry, are at the beginning of their journey, blockchain is enabling the consolidation of this data, providing for the first time the potential for a single and accurate top down view of the supply chain. Given Nestlé’s seemingly endless product lines across the world, Dubois does not expect to be able to make traceability as advanced as the current trial with Zoégas for every single commodity. But he is adamant that blockchain, for now, is a crucial component in continuing to evolve the company’s mission, and it can serve as an example in the process.  “The food marketplace is evolving and we have this scale of operation, providing this healthy food throughout the world – but it’s about showing consumers where we’re sourcing it and what we put in place to ensure that you know that food is good and healthy,” Dubois said.“When you look at the purpose of Nestlé – to unlock the power of food and enhance the quality of life for everyone – I think technology and data and transparency is critical to that, so that consumers can trust what they buy.”",Why Nestlé is embracing blockchain in its complex global supply chain,https://techwireasia.com/2020/07/why-nestle-is-embracing-blockchain-in-its-complex-global-supply-chain/,28 July 2020

Eric Jing, former CEO and now executive chairman, told Within that wider fintech services outlook, Ant Group – and the entire Alibaba Group – has long been bullish on the power of blockchain technology. Despite skepticism around cryptocurrency, former Alibaba Group CEO Jack Ma said that blockchain would “reshape the world’s financial system” in the course of the next 20 years. However, the new fire behind AntChain is thought by many to be a bid to ‘follow the breadcrumbs’ of governmental confidence in the technology as a national infrastructure. Ant has already signed a deal with one of China’s seven economic zones, Zhuhai, to provide blockchain solutions connecting the region’s governments, banks and end-users, enabling the sharing of financial documents, including title deeds, credit history and mortgage applications with the aim of digitizing the home purchasing process. Building governmental partnerships also allows the company to cross-sell and upsell other products and services as well. But while getting cosy with the government is all great business, ambitions for AntChain go further than that. With a huge amount of businesses, especially SMEs, using Alibaba Cloud – the tech that the blockchain platform is built on – AntChain isn’t just a blockchain company, but part of a suite of solutions that these customers can leverage. AntChain certainly has the vehicles and fuel reserves it needs to drive wide scale adoption of blockchain technology among businesses in China and even further afield. And the US, it seems, will be sitting on the sidelines.

The company has been rapidly scaling up the platform from 50 household farmers to one that now comprises 500 across two communities. The goal of BlocRice is to ensure farmers can sell their product at a higher price and that the country’s main food sources can be identified. Since its original pilot less than two years ago, the platform has become commercially viable, assigning digital identities to individual farmers, and ensuring their goods can be tracked from rice paddies all the way to the consumer. It seeks to give farmers a ‘voice’ in the supply chain, and help them to optimize and grow their operations through cooperatives with other producers and access to tech solutions and extension services.Thanks to blockchain’s key tenets – the immutable storage of data, visible in real-time to any party provided with access – retailers and consumers can gain clear insight into how their food was produced and just how much the farmers that made it are really benefiting from the industry. Kann Kunthy, vice-president of Amru Rice, Cambodia told Kunthy’s view is that the use of blockchain and other innovative agritech solutions can both help to modernize and enrich a traditional industry, helping to turn seasonal household farmers into commercial, professional farmers that are market-oriented. Projects such as BlocRice can also stimulate the growth of the country’s fledgling tech industry, both fostering and attracting new talent and technology firms into the region.  However, Kunthy said that digital infrastructure and innovations such as these can thrive only if they are matched by physical infrastructure support, such as logistics, transportation, post-harvest management, storage and delivery, which requires training, education and the further establishment of agricultural cooperatives. The ultimate goal, she said, was to help Cambodia’s farmers become ‘agri-preneurs’. Across Asia, the risks driven by climate change and, more recently, the effects of COVID-19, have contributed to declining produce outputs and farmers are struggling to make sites both sustainable and profitable. But the contribution of the agriculture sector has been steadily declining from 2003 towards 2016, as shown in recently released World Bank data.The ripple effect of this decline is wide. In South Asian countries like Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan, jobs in agriculture make up nearly half of the total employment and account for 39% total employment across Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Myanmar, among others.At the intersection between agriculture and next-generation technologies, agritech is a fast emerging area of focus for innovative entrepreneurs and startups, seeking to leverage tech like IoT, analytics, AI robotics and blockchain to drive efficiencies to save costs and increase yields. Wider goals in agritech are frequently to boost standards of living for a huge part of the population and drive sustainable agriculture practices.

But as we begin to emerge from a recession, sights will be set on technologies that can drive longer-term advantages, and blockchain could find itself quickly creeping back up that ladder of priorities. According to The Business Research Company, despite a dip this year, the global blockchain market is expected to hit US$15.88 billion in 2023 despite retreating 7.27% to US$2.27 billion in 2020 — representing potential annual growth of over 91%.In the circumstances, there is also an opportunity for more agile blockchain platforms to generate fresh interest throughout the remainder of 2020 by catering to the unique needs of the post-pandemic business.

With the higher adoption of For instance, When remote teams are more Without the physical identity of a workplace, a company can use gamification to teach new employees about the company, products, processes, culture, and ethos. Newly-employed team members could take a virtual tour of the company; quizzes could be sent about members of the team or different areas of the business.Going further, instead of team days or after-work drinks, culture can be developed and adapted for the new way of working with gamified teamwork or contests, such as ‘leagues’ and fantasy sports.Elements like sales charts and performance targets can be gamified with elements like rewards points, leaderboards, and a hierarchy of levels that the worker can ‘progress’ through. Positive outcomes for the individual and the team can be rewarded with appreciation badges and recognition within the entire company infrastructure.For all benefits that gamifying remote work processes can deliver, there could be drawbacks as well.

IoT medical equipment is being used to IoT devices are enabling While the number of IoT-enabled devices and their real-world applications have been booming, cybersecurity specialists say that security on IoT equipment still lags far behind– Cybersecurity for IoT devices has never been more critical, as the plethora of newly-connected devices represent an exposed aspect of any company with ‘connected enterprise’ aspirations for their operations. IoT device endpoints could be exploited by hackers and other bad actors to gain access to the rest of the interconnected systems present on a company’s IT and OT connected infrastructure.Older cybersecurity systems might not be primed to protect internet-capable devices at all, and would need system upgrades to incorporate IoT device protection. Furthermore, the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has seen numerous new ransomware and malware threats emerge that are targeting vulnerable endpoints, and these might zero in on exposed IoT devices that link to the rest of the company’s systems.Enterprise-grade IoT security solutions already exist out there, so organizations need to ensure they are protecting these often-overlooked security endpoints. Companies need to place emphasis on updating and maintaining security patches for connected IoT devices the same as for the rest of their networked systems, and furthermore the updating and routine maintenance of cybersecurity measures need to be conducted on a regular basis.IoT devices might have represented a fraction of a company’s IT infrastructure in the past, but their importance has grown steadily over the past couple of years, and the situation had only been exacerbated by the coronavirus. Considering the threats facing the connected enterprise in this new landscape, it would be wise for companies to make IoT device security an integral part of their cybersecurity measures from this point onwards.",Shielding the IoT connected enterprise in the era of COVID-19,https://techwireasia.com/2020/05/shielding-the-iot-connected-enterprise-in-the-era-of-covid-19/,29 May 2020

This could add an additional layer of security and work well for earnings audits, but when records need to be updated constantly, a solution like A smart contract is a binding digital agreement between two parties that is securely recorded on the blockchain. The network is able to store billions of points of data. “Television ad impressions can reach about 3 hundred billion impressions per month.

However, even cautious supply chain leaders must keep an open mind and embrace long-term perpetual change.”Hyper-automation is a framework to mix and match a vast array of technologies in the best possible way – such as historic legacy platforms with recently deployed tools and planned investments. The term means different things for different organizations, so supply chain leaders must first find their individual definition. If deployed correctly, hyper-automation can encourage broader collaboration across domains and act as an integrator for disparate and siloed functions. A DSCT is a digital representation of the physical supply chain. It is derived from all relevant data across the supply chain and its operating environment. That makes the DSCT the basis for all local and end-to-end decision making. “DSCTs are part of the digital theme that describes an ever-increasing merger of the digital and physical world,” Titze said. “Linking both worlds enhances situational awareness and supports decision-making.”Continuous intelligence (CI) is one of the biggest opportunities for supply chain leaders to accelerate their organizations’ digital transformation. It leverages a computer’s ability to process data at a much faster pace than people can. Supply chain leaders – or other systems – can look at the processed data in near real-time, understand what is happening and take action immediately. “There are already several use cases for CI in decision support and decision automation. For example, This is an increasingly important macro trend, as global risk events are on the rise and security breaches impact companies on both the digital and physical level. “Gartner anticipates a wave of new solutions to emerge for supply chain security and governance, especially in the fields of privacy as well as cyber and data security,” Titze said. “Think advanced track-and-trace solutions, smart packaging and next-gen RFID and NFC capabilities.”The rise of edge computing – where data is processed and analyzed close to its collection point – coincides with the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It’s the technology you need when there is a demand for low-latency processing and real-time, automated decision making.Edge computing is right now making its way into the manufacturing industry. For example, some organizations have adopted driverless forklifts for their warehouses. Heavy equipment sellers can use edge computing to analyze when a part needs maintenance or replacement. AI in the supply chain consists of a toolbox of technology options that help companies understand complex content, engage in natural dialogue with people, enhance human performance and take over routine tasks.“AI technology is present in a lot of already existing solutions, but its capabilities evolve on a constant basis,” Mr. Titze added. “Currently, the technology primarily helps supply chain leaders solve long-standing challenges around data silos and governance. Its capabilities allow for more visibility and integration across networks of stakeholders that were previously remote or disparate.” Compared to its predecessors, HOW AUSTRALIA’S BEGA CHEESE SLICES THROUGH THE SUPPLY CHAIN WITH IOTImmersive experience technology, such as virtual, augmented and mixed reality, has the potential to radically influence the trajectory of supply chain management. Those new interaction models amplify human capabilities. “Companies already see the benefits of immersive experiences in use cases like onboarding new factory workers through immersive on-the-job training in a safe, realistic virtual environment,” Titze concluded. ",Eight ways the supply chain is getting more tech-powered,https://techwireasia.com/2020/07/eight-ways-the-supply-chain-is-getting-more-tech-powered/,20 July 2020

Automation technology holds the key.Business leaders in the manufacturing and logistics sector will have little doubt today that their investments into automation will be money well spent, and we can expect investments in Industry 4.0 technology to be expedited and the pace of innovation to ramp up further as vendors eye the forthcoming boom in interest from new stakeholders. But the interest in automation is manifold; not only can it optimize evermore data-driven logistics chains and reduce downtime, make supply chain systems more resilient to disruption, and save ultimately save costs in terms of human labor – making supply chains ‘contactless’ from production to delivery could become a vital ingredient to kindling business again in the wake of the pandemic. Ensuring businesses and customers feel safe handling goods might just become a significant medium-term business differentiator, demonstrating that those businesses are prudent and forward-thinking as we emerge from a health crisis and must continue to keep transmission down. While we can already see plenty of examples of technology in action in supply chains today which omit humans from the picture, such as In Japan, the need for automation is especially prevalent, particularly as its aging workforce is driving a very real need for alternatives to human labor on the production line. But the complications of the pandemic, and the pressure caused by a subsequent surge in e-commerce, has led to an increasing interest in the country’s supply chain automation companies. As reported by According to researcher Fuji Keizai, the market for next-gen logistics systems is set to hit “Demand for humanless systems will keep growing,” Masafumi Okamoto, division manager at Osaka-based Tsubakimoto, told the publication, as e-commerce and the need for contactless supply chain technology combines to drive demand.It’s not just under the cover of factories and warehouses where this automation technology will play a leading role.

Businesses are adopting next-gen technologies to fulfill growing consumer demands. The Australian dairy product company is not immune to the need businesses have to keep pace with digitalization. Projects are unfolding worldwide, especially in the food and beverage sector.  In 2016, Bega Cheese was reported to have invested heavily in an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system that they anticipated would “ultimately result in improved business information, integration, efficiencies, and decision making.” These developments came following the merger between Bega Cheese and Tatura Milk Industries in 2011, with the newly created partnership aiming to consolidate its operations on a single and Some of the benefits Bega Cheese envisioned include automated processes, enhanced tracking of milk and ingredients in real time, integrated business planning, and imposed data standards across the business. The dairy company’s goal of upgrading its business operations with technology continues, and Bega Cheese is now leveling up its digitalization game by enlisting the Internet of Things (IoT) in its supply chain.The ASX-listed dairy company is launching an IoT service that connects its farmer suppliers, milk transporters, and their storage and processing facilities with real-time data. The IoT-backed system will offer details of milk production with farmer suppliers , which includes information like milk volume, temperature, quality composition, and transport conditions. The collected data from these key areas is poised to improve efficiencies in pickup and delivery frequencies, lowering costs, and improving the overall traceability of the product.The project scope can be seen to follow a chain of processes, from gathering the raw data from the dairy, to deriving information from its valuable data, to churning them to actionable insights, and finally to presenting these actionable insights to help stakeholders decide the next best course of action.LTransparency in the supply chain is gaining popularity as consumer awareness on the environmental price tag of products is rising and becoming a key factor when making a purchase. Swiss brand More recently, GM Supply Chain at Bega Cheese, Adel Salman, told Therefore, the collaboration of Bega Cheese with “Swinburne University of Technology with its Internet of Things Lab and Industry 4.0 initiatives as well as its research partnership with Software AG was the perfect collaborator for us.”Salman added, “Swinburne University listened to what we needed to achieve and, together with Software AG, developed an IoT strategy with a set of solutions that met our needs.ARE WE ON THE PATH TO FULLY-CONTACTLESS AUTOMATED SUPPLY CHAINS?“We’re excited to see the benefits that IoT can bring to our company. By working with Swinburne University and Software AG, we hope to be able to increase our growth across higher-value premium products, thus enhancing the competitiveness for both Bega and our suppliers.”",How Australia’s Bega Cheese slices through the supply chain with IoT,https://techwireasia.com/2020/07/how-australias-bega-cheese-slices-through-the-supply-chain-with-iot/,15 July 2020

It will serve as the backbone technology to new high-bandwidth, low-latency applications, supporting things like vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology, and personalized services that leverage real-time data.But for 100 smart city experts, surveyed by Fotech, smart cities should be taking advantage more of existing technologies and infrastructure, rather than waiting for the roll-out of new tech like 5G. Four out of five respondents (80%) claimed to be more likely to invest in a smart city project based on existing infrastructure rather than one requiring the installation of new technology.While we could be quick to dispel the findings as a result of concerns over the expense of new technological infrastructure, cost of deployment was considered a barrier by just over a third (35%), while data privacy concerns were the main issue among nearly a half (49%).According to Fobar, this is an indication that while enhancing the ‘data view’ of cities is essential to providing the insight needed to meet the demands of urbanization and societal changes, the assumption that entirely new infrastructure will be at the heart of these systems may be false.Chris Shannon, CEO of Fotech Solutions, said the findings “highlight the need for more practical approaches to creating smart city systems – using innovation to extract more value from infrastructure that has already been expensively installed.”He continued: “Avoiding the cost and disruption of rolling out new technologies and capitalizing on existing infrastructure – such as fiber optic networks and 4G technology for example – could have huge benefits for cities around the world and significantly shorten the ‘time to value’ for smart city projects.”Smart cities are less about piling new technology into our urban spaces, as though installing a Google Home system into a 200-year-old mansion. The concept is really about making the existing environment work better for its citizens, making cities more sustainable, and improving residents’ quality of life — that means that if the technology works for Copenhagen, it won’t, by default, work for Rio de Janeiro.Technology is only as significant as the positive difference it makes on people’s lives. In TechHQThrough a focus on smart solutions integration, digital technologies, services, and social innovation, Planet’s core aim is to enhance the quality of life experienced by residents and to do so the firm employs technology that varies dramatically from community to community.“Our unique model sees us factor in the needs and wants of each local community […],” Chief Digital Strategy, Alan Marcus explained. “In Smart City Laguna, we have introduced solutions such as a library of things, free communal Wi-Fi, shared, public spaces, and an innovation hub, developed to provide a foundation for shared living and host free educational courses for residents and the surrounding community.”Marcus continued: “Our smart solutions aren’t always super-advanced futuristic solutions but actually looking at ways we can use these technologies smarter to improve the lives of all of our residents.”COULD THE PANDEMIC AFFECT OUR PERSPECTIVE ON SMART CITIES?The firm strives to “introduce new processes and programs that lead to a change in daily routines, in resource abilities, relationships or values of the community.” It is such a foundation that can drive more rounded success in the field of PropTech, with businesses and developers able to “utilize technology to build efficiency within those processes”. For example, utilizing smart meters and energy efficiency programs to change the relationship residents have with energy usage, or a neighborhood watch program utilizing CCTV.So, while the term ‘smart cities’ might conjure visions of cool, clean urban space enriched with advanced new technologies, at its core, the concept is about simply being smarter with the technology already in place.","Smart cities don’t need 5G, they just need smart thinking",https://techwireasia.com/2020/09/smart-cities-dont-need-5g-they-just-need-smart-thinking/,9 September 2020

But, while we could reel out more examples of this potential, there is perhaps a never more powerful metaphor for AI’s utility in this respect than it being deployed to That’s exactly what scientists from Warwick University have done — so if you needed some inspirational motivation to employ machine learning techniques, this might be it. Researchers used a machine-learning algorithm to confirm the existence of 50 new planets. In much the same way as described above, a research team from Warwick University fed the algorithm huge datasets from NASA’s retired Kepler mission and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) space telescope launched in 2018. In what’s hoped to be a new approach for future planet validation, the algorithm was trained to differentiate between planets and false positives amid the noise of and inference caused by objects in the background and occasional errors in the camera. The algorithm was then launched into a separate, unvalidated data set on a mission to validate celestial bodies. Dr. David Armstrong, from the department of physics at the University of Warwick, said: “The algorithm we have developed lets us take fifty candidates across the threshold for planet validation, upgrading them to real planets.” The program also generated the probability of each planet being real. Those planets validated ranged from the size of Earth to the size of Neptune, with orbits varying from one day to 200 days. “A survey like TESS is predicted to have tens of thousands of planetary candidates and it is ideal to be able to analyze them all consistently,” said Armstrong.“Where typical sky surveys identify thousands of potential planets, it’s left to human astronomers to distinguish real planets from the information. “Fast, automated systems like this that can take us all the way to validated planets in fewer steps let us do that efficiently.“We still have to spend time training the algorithm, but once that is done it becomes much easier to apply it to future candidates.”TechHQBy using nothing more than patterns in text, an algorithm made valid scientific predictions.Dr. Anubhav Jain“I think it’s theoretically possible to do something like that but there’s still a lot of practical issues in all of these things that prevent it from being right around the corner.”",AI confirmed 50 new planets from NASA data — imagine what your business could do,https://techwireasia.com/2020/08/ai-confirmed-50-new-planets-from-nasa-data-imagine-what-your-business-could-do/,28 August 2020

For the rest, the urgency to engage and advance digital transformation strategies has been kicked up a notch.Even at the most basic level, cloud-based tools such as Zoom and Teams have kept workforces in touch and productive from their respective homes. Elsewhere, AI-powered chatbots have bolstered overburdened customer service divisions, automation technologies have allowed smaller teams to reallocate limited resources, and advanced cybersecurity solutions are ensuring distributed workforces are protected. Technology has played a leading role in enabling businesses to continue to operate. As the significance of that has been placed center-stage, there’s now little doubt among businesses that investing in digital is the only way to both survive the fallout, and remain competitive going forward. But as the world of business enters into a period of economic uncertainty and faces a “cash crunch”, many companies are unconfident they have the funds secured to back investments in new technology. That’s according to a new report by HFS Research and KPMG dubbed Nearly 60% of respondents agree that COVID-19 has created a drive to accelerate digital transformation, but just 13% expect to increase investment in emerging tech as a result. Business objectives are, for now, focused on survival, and that means ensuring work from home arrangements are functioning as a more viable permanent solution, automation tools are in place, and opportunities are taken to crowdsource talent from a wider pool of remote candidates. On the other hand, objectives like growth, acquisitions to entering new markets, making cultural changes, and reskilling and training have taken more of a backseat. Since the full force of the pandemic was realized, the perception of importance in investments into emerging technologies — including AI, hybrid and multi-cloud, smart analytics and process automation — has shifted away from cost reduction, improved decision-making ability, and improved brand value. Instead, investments here are considered “essential for future survival” across the board. With much more at stake from their limited budgets, businesses must focus on mature “have-to-have” technologies, said HFS, such as cloud, automation, and analytics, that may drive quicker ROI. On the other hand, more nascent technologies like edge computing, blockchain, AI, and 5G have seen budgets pulled back by more than 50% in most cases. Hybrid and multi-cloud investments are regarded as perhaps the most important post-COVID investments, but the value of automation is also seeing an uptick in technologies like Business Process Management software, Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and Work from home arrangements — and the increased vulnerabilities of multiple endpoints and BYOD usage — has meanwhile led cybersecurity to become a “c-level mandate”. With the exception of process automation, which more than a third of companies claim to have seen immediate value from, the added pressure to invest in the technology “essentials” comes with the fact the majority believe they won’t see significant value for at least 1-2 years. Ensuring this technology is onboarded as soon as possible, then, is crucial. Even among the “have-to-have” technologies, however, there are challenges in realizing value in investments towards digital transformation. Post-COVID, leaders report that making the business case for investments and securing buy-in from the C-Suite have become some of the hardest tasks. Ahead of the pandemic, businesses considered overcoming the organizational cultural changes the biggest potential roadblock, but this has become much less of a concern today.If there’s a silver lining to all the talk of tight purse strings, it’s that the majority IT buyers expect to be ramping up their spending once again within the next year.

In fact, the continent accounts for six out of the top 10 most congested cities in the latest year ranking by Dutch location tech specialists In the Indian capital of Delhi, drivers in the sprawling metropolis spend as much as 58% more time stuck in traffic compared to drivers in any other city in the world. With the problem only getting worse, city officials have been determined to find a workable solution. That quest led them to a new intelligent traffic management system driven by Intelligent traffic management systems refer to the usage of AI, machine learning, computer vision, sensors, and data analysis tools to collect and analyze traffic data, generate solutions, and apply them to the traffic infrastructure.In Delhi, over 7,500 CCTV cameras, automated traffic lights, and one thousand LED signs carry sensors and cameras that are compiling real-time data on traffic conditions, which the AI processes into Alibaba’s City Brain is perhaps one of the most widely-distributed intelligent traffic management systems in Asia. The AI-powered system is already in deployment in 23 cities in China, as well as in other countries such as Malaysia. Gathering data such as video from intersection cameras and GPS data on the location of cars and buses, the platform crunches information in real-time and coordinates more than 1,000 road signals around the city with the aim of preventing or easing gridlock.In Hangzhou, Alibaba’s base, the thriving metropolis of 7 million people was once ranked fifth among China’s most congested cities but has now dropped to 57th on the list.Speaking to CNN, the company says that after two years of testing, the system appears to have shortened commutes and also helped first respondents by enabling fire trucks and ambulances to halve the amount of time it takes to respond to emergencies.“The cities in China are probably facing more challenges than any other city,” said Wang Jian, chairman of Alibaba’s technology steering committee, who said the technology could pave the way for other smart city applications.Municipalities with smart city aspirations are increasingly turning to AI-driven traffic solutions like this. Saudi Arabia, for instance, has a stated aim to transform into a smart nation as part of its Vision 2030 initiative. One of its major industrial hubs, Yanbu Industrial City, began integrating the AI-powered intelligent traffic management systems from Huawei, which now comprises over 250 high-definition cameras working at 16 major road intersections, supplying high-quality images and videos that feed data for officials to take immediate or planned actions.The Intelligent Traffic Management System (ITMS) pushes AI to the fore, running smart algorithms to automatically identify traffic violations including running red lights, crossing lanes, reverse driving, and lane marking infractions, among others. The response is much faster, running about 100,000 data records and capable of receiving a response within seconds.In addition to improving traffic conditions, ITMS also contributes towards Traffic management systems help to manage traffic and avoid accidents on the road, but they will also enable the traffic-choked cities in Asia to be more prepared to adopt autonomous vehicles which have a significantly less environmental footprint.What’s more, the power of AI that propels a lot of the data analysis of these systems, is also what powers the navigation systems of ride-hailing as well as last-mile delivery operators. Deliveries or order fulfillments that had to be delayed in the past, can now be enhanced significantly as cities around Asia continue taking up such intelligent traffic systems.",AI-powered traffic management is slashing Asia’s congestion problem,https://techwireasia.com/2020/08/ai-powered-traffic-management-is-slashing-asias-congestion-problem/,28 August 2020

Alibaba-owned Ant, for instance, scrutinizes This is in stark contrast with the traditional banking sector, where usually the financial institution is extending credit based on the available collateral, and credit-lending facilities are limited by the user’s existing, available credit data, thereby ruling out around 2 billion people globally without bank histories from participating, and contributing, towards the local economy.“Their access to big data is not the only potential advantage for big techs over banks,” the BIS said in a With micro-lending and credit availability from fintech firms around Asia set to increase, the provision of such financial services could help SMBs to secure stabilized financing, particularly for those smaller -companies which might struggle to get a traditional bank loan.In addition, the BIS whitepaper found that the looser regulatory framework around credit from the big tech giants of Asia means that SMBs are able to secure a larger supply of credit. Virtual credit facilities also do not become pricier as the market becomes more volatile, which does happen with traditional bank credit.“The tech giants control such an enormous part of our lives online, financial services could be one of those things that could make sense for them to offer,” “They certainly have the necessary ingredients to make good investment decisions, such as massive amounts of data, artificial intelligence capabilities, and smart people,” added Thusith Mahanama, the co-founder and CEO of the Boston-based client reporting services provider Assette LLC.",How Asia’s fintechs are upending traditional loans,https://techwireasia.com/2020/09/how-big-techs-data-driven-approach-to-credit-could-steady-smes/,8 September 2020

Thailand’s Board of Investment is so intent on an IoT revolution that it offers a range of investment incentives to support, promote and tax-exempt businesses that develop/adopt IoT and related digital technologies, including eligibility to receive up to eight years of corporate tax exemption and non-tax privileges.So as IoT offers inevitable productivity improvements and energy savings to business consumers, what could get in the way, and what challenges do such enterprises face?The ‘ifs’ and ‘buts’ were recently outlined by Jesada Sivaraks, head of government and industry relations at Ericsson (Thailand); he told a webinar that, despite it being a priority, Thailand’s “ecosystem is not ready for IoT.”Similarly, CAT Telecom president Col Sanpachai Huvanandana said that “only a robust digital infrastructure” can promote digital transformation. So, what of these obstacles?The complex connection of machines with the cloud is at the core of IoT’s capabilities, from factories to farming. However, there are a number of bureaucratic obstacles that have been acknowledged as potentially stymying Thailand’s progress.The country’s state regulations are complex, and overcoming the “somewhat archaic ecosystem of Thailand 3.0” is wrought with time-consuming approval procedures. For factory and warehouse owners especially, there are concerns over the timescales needed to transition to IoT and the impact of this shift towards automation on immediate ROI.There are also the implications of context, and making sure IoT solutions are adapted to suit the Thai economy/digital market. According to Mr. Jesada, the challenge of IoT adoption is “the network, which covers device makers, service providers, and solutions as well as the government and users”. He points to a need to “make IoT devices fit with the network and build complete local networks, again a time-consuming and rigorous process.”Finally, the overcoming of doubt will be key. Jesada says that “citizens and small businesses should not be afraid of technology, which can usher in new opportunities for careers and business models”.With Thailand set to continue its digital transformation, and in striving towards smart industries, 5G and IoT will take center stage. If the nation can shift some of the infrastructural, bureaucratic concerns, they may well be a pioneer in the Southeast Asian market.

China also calls on state actors to oppose mass surveillance against other states and to refrain from installing backdoors in their tech products, which can be accessed for illegal big data gathering – all charges which have been leveled at Beijing in the past.In announcing the new data initiative, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi took a hilarious dig at the Trump administration’s Clean Network.“A certain country keeps making groundless accusations against others in the name of a ‘clean’ network and uses security as a pretext to prey on enterprises of other countries that have a competitive edge.

Perhaps one of the most standout trends has been the rise of increasingly innovative ‘social commerce’ strategies.According to a recent survey by Facebook, 85% of Southeast Asian respondents have said that they had tried new digital apps for the first time in Q1 of this year.The most popular new apps have been social media, video streaming, and instant messaging applications, followed by e-commerce, food delivery, and digital payments platforms. Using a combination of these app categories to target consumers is known as social commerce.Social commerce is not a new trend in Indonesia, where cosmetic brand micro agents have for years been utilizing Facebook and WhatsApp (Indonesia ranks in the top five countries in terms of usage for both of these platforms) to connect and hawk their products to a wider audience, both in groups and via one-on-one chats. Social platforms in Southeast Asia’s largest economy have traditionally relied on a reseller model. Direct e-commerce platforms have struggled to find their place in the vast country, separated from potential buyers by huge distances, lack of reliable internet connections, and a dearth of online delivery services that reach many of its rural areas.This disconnect with rural buyers has alienated e-commerce services, confining their distribution reach to mostly urban centers like Jakarta and Surabaya.Goldman Sachs This model has proven effective in Indonesia, especially among communities that are less used to conducting e-commerce transactions. “Our Indonesia’s micro approach is in stark contrast to the gargantuan ‘Both local brands and major international ones like China’s shoppertainment model might differ greatly from the social commerce approach underway in Indonesia, but it will be interesting to see how the opposite approaches might progress in a post-pandemic setting.",Will social commerce in Indonesia rival China’s shoppertainment?,https://techwireasia.com/2020/07/will-social-commerce-in-indonesia-rival-chinas-shoppertainment/,9 July 2020

So when you talk about ‘frictionless’, you want to make the checkout as seamless as possible.”New self-checkout systems using AI-driven computer vision capabilities can help with fresh produce management in stores, and enable loss prevention. “You don’t see self-checkout prevalence in Southeast Asia as yet compared to the more matured markets like Australia, New Zealand, or Japan, so what we are working on in that space is around ‘Hey, how can I recognize the products?“If I scan an apple, [the system] would know it is an apple without needing a barcode. And not only an apple, what kind of apple it is. Is it crunchy, is it a Fuji apple, or whatever? And the database behind the system is constantly learning the behaviors as well as what people are scanning.“The benefit of all this, of course, is a seamless, frictionless experience for the end-user– but it also helps the seller doing loss prevention. This part of the roadmap we actually demonstrated this year at the NRF this year, and I’d say in the next few months you will see these stuff being rolled out from our side.”Research by card provider Visa recently found that 66% of consumers in Singapore are “The first step in Southeast Asian countries has to be the acceptance of self-checkout.

This sales growth, coupled with dispatch and delivery delays associated with the increased volumes, led to unprecedented demands on the customer services teams,” said Daniele Iezzi, the customer services general manager at David Jones and Country Road Group“We saw increases of up to 500% in customer contact. Call volumes increased so quickly that at one stage customers were telephoning us every two seconds. Needless to say, wait times for calls ballooned out to levels we weren’t comfortable with.”Gartner reportsFor David Jones Australia, the company has decided to support its growing online sales by moving its maligned customer service operations to run on Amazon Connect and Salesforce cloud-based systems, to better manage customer feedback and ensure customer fulfillment is taking priority.Customer services GM Iezzi told “This placed pressure on the customer services team. The increase in online sales drove a 50% growth in phone calls to the team with the main inquiry being related to order status,” explained Iezzi. “Coupled with outdated systems, this demand was creating an experience that didn’t live up to our customers’ expectations.”David Jones decided to retain its customer relationship services in-house rather than outsourcing them, allowing the company to have a more direct grasp of their customers’ expectations, and brought in Deloitte to build a new platform based on Amazon Connect and Salesforce’s Service Cloud.Salesforce has repeatedly been ranked as one of the top customer service and support software vendors, with David Jones Australia is also using Amazon Connect’s “If you’re ringing to check on the status of your order, Amazon Connect will locate the order in your Salesforce profile, confirm its details with you, and then [make] an API call to our order management system and to our delivery partners [to] relay the order status to you, without the need for human intervention,” he continued. “This is really powerful as order status inquiries are still the main source of customer contacts to our team.”For out-of-hours calls, the system will create an ‘unresolved case’ in Service Cloud, filling in the details and reason for the call automatically. Amazon Connect can also determine to transfer calls to an agent, by looking at the customer’s profile info in Salesforce, identifying the caller by their phone number.The digital customer care platform has provided David Jones some of the space to pivot to additional support channels, such as transitioning store staff who were not working much during the lockdown, and redeploying them to handle excess online queries.“One of the great features of Amazon Connect and Service Cloud is the flexibility to scale up quite easily,” noted GM Iezzi. “As a result, we could redeploy these team members quickly using their own devices, and we could call on team members from any state to work with us remotely. They were able to hit the ground running.”In addition, David Jones Australia also increased its live chat and chatbot capacities, including using chatbots to better understand customer intent early and to obtain necessary customer information “such as their name, a case number or product information, helped reduce our handling time, and increase agent productivity in chat.”Iezzi says the capabilities of Amazon Connect and Salesforce allowed the retailer to keep “every channel of communication open” despite customer care agents undergoing the transition to work-from-home during Australia’s lockdown period.Buoyed by the recent customer response improvements, David Jones plans to identify opportunities “to automate further customer intents so that we can deflect more calls away from the customer services team.”“As we continue to leverage the power of Amazon Connect used in conjunction with Service Cloud, we will continue to gather information and insights about our customers, as each contact creates a case in the customer’s profile in Salesforce,” said Iezzi.David Jones is also planning to provide better tools to supplement the customer’s in-store experiences as well. “We’re looking to implement chat and messaging in-store,” Iezzi confirmed. “This will give customers more options in how they’d like to engage with our store teams, and allow sales assistants to view their customer’s shopping history, allowing them to sell the right product more easily and more efficiently. Naturally, this will be integrated with Service Cloud.”",Why Aussie department store David Jones went cloudwards for CX,https://techwireasia.com/2020/07/why-aussie-department-store-david-jones-went-cloudwards-for-cx/,23 July 2020

We had really strong sales growth and significantly reduced losses. The tailwinds we’re experiencing are accelerating our progress to build a healthier e-commerce business as we add new brands, improve product mix, grow the marketplace and achieve more fixed-cost leverage,” said Walmart President and CEO Doug McMillon. “The stores and online merchant teams are now integrated, and we believe we’ll benefit from that change going forward.”While Walmart International’s operating income was still down by 9.1%, “International’s results were better than anticipated coming into the quarter,” Walmart leveraged its scale and “When customers order through the [mobile] application they can choose to receive the contactless deliveries while checking out through the cart. With this, the driver also gets a notification that this is no contact delivery hence he leaves the items at the front door and steps back,” Vasudev explained. “And because we want to make sure that there is no option of fraud in this service, the drivers are asked to [take a] photo of the delivery items which they upload into the system. We use the same picture to push a notification to the customer that their order is out there and they can receive it.”Another new option was curbside pickup, currently rolled out in 5,200 stores throughout the US. Leveraging on the company’s existing store-to-doorstep pharmacy delivery mechanism, Walmart added a new option for customers to elect to pick up their orders from a designated pick up point, bypassing going into the store altogether. “So, we are putting a bunch of technologies in place that allows us to do appropriate bifurcation of the orders which helps us do the curbside with in-store sales,” said Vasudev.“Likewise, when it comes to delivering at customers’ doorsteps, we are putting solutions which allow us to do better round optimization. With this, our drivers are able to deliver more orders to customer’s home in the time when the customer orders have spiked.”Taking into consideration the social distancing regulations for physical stores, the chain has made changes to its in-store experience to minimize potential infection too. “We had rolled out scan-and-go implementation in all of our stores. Because of COVID-19, we have fine-tuned this implementation and scaled it up in some areas. It takes a lot to perfect any technology and scale it up,” Vasudev added. “But what our technology teams have done is commendable.

Virtual credit facilities also do not become pricier as the market becomes more volatile, which does happen with traditional bank credit.“The tech giants control such an enormous part of our lives online, financial services could be one of those things that could make sense for them to offer,” “They certainly have the necessary ingredients to make good investment decisions, such as massive amounts of data, artificial intelligence capabilities, and smart people,” added Thusith Mahanama, the co-founder and CEO of the Boston-based client reporting services provider Assette LLC.",How Asia’s fintechs are upending traditional loans,https://techwireasia.com/2020/09/how-big-techs-data-driven-approach-to-credit-could-steady-smes/,8 September 2020
