However, data alone in its raw, unstructured form won’t be of any use. It must be converted into statistics, charts and graphs that can be analyzed for patterns and trends that can inform the business’s next move.That’s where data’s real power lies.According to a recent This is why over the last few years, businesses have been consistently told that they need to assess, process, analyze and contextualize the data that their operations generate.These businesses are also more likely to launch new products that hit the mark with their audience, putting them a foot ahead of rivals.Data is a critical ingredient in ensuring businesses are able to accurately satisfy market demands, improve products and services effectively, personalize marketing strategies, augment business operations, reduce operational costs, and boost profits.The benefits of acting on as much as the information available are clear, so what are the some of the best approaches to becoming ‘data-driven’?To tap into all these possibilities, enterprise leaders must adopt and practice a data-driven culture across the organization. Investing in hiring the right data talents and having a chief in-command would be a good start.Data must be managed effectively, so having a team that can coordinate such a task would profoundly benefit the enterprise.Leveraging the right analytics tools and business intelligence systems will foster the success of data teams even more. To be data leaders, enterprises shouldn’t shy away from making the right investments – and that also means provisioning some budget to Automating all data-related workflows and processes should also be on the agenda. Data teams can then focus on retrieving as much intelligence and insights as possible to mobilize new product development, coordinate improved marketing strategies and minimize without human errors.Analysts in these teams could also benefit from artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities that could help them process a larger amount of data and accelerate decision-making processes.This then leads to the next move which is to define your data strategies and initiatives.In doing so, enterprises must synchronize efforts with data teams to measure the volume of data that business is generating. Knowing the information assets an enterprise has can really help operations teams identify where they stand with data and the goals that should be achieved within a period of time.Now that the data infrastructure has been established, leaders have to make sure that all operational units are in-tune with the data initiatives.To do that successfully, enterprises must focus on making data dashboards and tools available to the workforce. It’s really important that all teams are able to While it’s not always a walk in the part to win big with data, leading enterprises have proven that with the right strategies and mindset, all is possible. The key is to coordinate efforts with the entire workforce and trust the data.",How are data-driven businesses turning information into revenue?,https://techwireasia.com/2020/03/how-are-data-driven-businesses-turning-informations-into-revenue/,25 March 2020

Or in other words, they are acting less on events, hearsay and instinct, and more on the hard information they have in front of them. Of course, combing through this vast mass of data – generated, collected and stored across various departments and databases throughout the business – is a key challenge, and one that Business Intelligence tools have sought to solve. Business Intelligence (BI) strategies and technologies have been around for years now; enterprises are no strangers to them, leveraging their power in interpreting big data to uncover insights, and to present business and market forecasts, with the end goal of driving a competitive advantage and long-term success. Put simply, these tools – and their many other offshoots – are enabling businesses and individuals within them to act on the data they have in front of them, every day, across a mass of different uses and applications. Those are strong advantages in ‘peacetime’, but in the midst of a crisis, and looming economic uncertainty, the pluspoints of these tools are now being magnified further. The fact is, most markets are in decline – and will be for an extended, and unknown, length of time. Customers have reduced buying power, and that means businesses must optimize what they have, pushing their now limited resources into where the real opportunities can be seized against equally hungry competitors.Instincts may work to a degree in turbulent times, but utilizing the information available is a much more effective strategy. That seems to explain the findings from Sisense’s As the report goes on to say, it demonstrates the increased importance businesses are placing on “If we’ve learned anything during COVID-19, no matter how tumultuous the economic environment, businesses of all sizes indicate an interest and optimism in their ability to leverage technologies like data analytics to help guide them through critical decision making,” said Howard Dresner, chief research officer of Dresner Advisory Services, told The report continued that BI and analytics are proving as important as ever, but offering “increased clarity in a time of tremendous uncertainty.”Companies are using BI and data in new ways, turning usage to address the most pressing challenges right now. For example, 55 percent of businesses have started utilizing data to improve efficiency, and claim to rely on it to predict changes and outcomes. Interestingly, smaller businesses (those between 51 and 200 employees) are leading the charge and adopting new use cases for their data. They are outpacing larger enterprises in the use of analytics across every department, according to the report. “Robust use of data analytics is no longer simply the mark of an industry leader but a crucial quality for the success and even survival of most companies,” said Amir Orad, CEO of Sisense. “Companies who adopt data-driven decision making separate themselves from the pack. With analytics they find those vital pivot points and thrive versus facing existential danger.” Orad said he was aware of a Fortune 500 company whose revenue had dropped more than 95 percent due to the current crisis, while their analytics usage had shot up by 40 percent – “And this is not a single or unique anecdote.”While businesses are quickly turning to these tools to gain a clearer market strategy, it may also be that they are better utilizing the resources at their disposal as budgets run tighter, and a review of the tools they need will have likely taken place. A commonly-cited challenge with BI and data analytics tools is that, despite being heavy investments, businesses don’t make use of them to their full capacity. Now, businesses are re-evaluating what they have and how they should use it, and they are squeezing more out of their business intelligence tools. And whether that’s for the end goal of improving business efficiency, reducing expenses or better supporting customers, BI tools can be the key to unlocking the data organizations needed to weather this storm, and to keep them thriving long term.

With big data, organizations can factor in other metrics that impact sales, making their forecast more reasonable.So, there’s no doubt that collecting data is helpful. Neglecting to collect or procure data can be quite a disadvantage to most organizations, especially because their competitors have access to it and are constantly looking for creative ways to exploit it for growth.Truth be told, as a result of technologies In the retail industry, for example, smart shelves can help store managers ensure that customers always find the right items, in the right spot, and at the right time. But if consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies tap into this data, they can get more intelligent with their distribution to ensure deliveries are prioritized to stores where demand is high.Using big data in real time creates specific advantages – but the uses cases must be thought through.In the case of the retail industry partnering with CPG players, while sensors on smart shelves collect plenty of data, CPG companies could create a smart workflow with edge computing architecture processing all data to make sure only relevant data is passed on to supply chain managers empowered to handle logistics on the ground.Collecting big data has its advantages, but there’s a cost associated with storing it all (even if it is only archived). Further, if not used quickly, or in real-time, it might not be very useful at all.CPG players collecting data from smart shelves in retail stores get the most out of it only when they process it in real-time.If they process it later, it could help identify trends in demand that correlate with other factors such as season, affluency in a neighborhood, and so on, but is unlikely to have a direct and immediate impact on sales.Further, not every bit of the data might be useful, so organizations that plan to continue collecting data for the foreseeable future need to come up with a plan to assess their data streams and understand which sets need to be saved for the future and which have a short lifespan and must be analyzed immediately and deleted.Real-time big data analytics, in most cases, isn’t hard. It’s limited by the imagination of business leaders and has already provided outsized returns for those willing to go beyond their comfort zone.",The relevance of big data and the importance of real-time access,https://techwireasia.com/2020/05/the-relevance-of-big-data-and-the-importance-of-real-time-access/,27 May 2020

These up-and-coming players are offering digital solutions that reduce friction, whilst offering personalized, data-driven services to increasingly tech-savvy customers all over Asia.Asian insurtech players are taking big steps forward and are in the process of revitalizing a once stuffy industry and looking to grab the attention and business of a new breed of customers.A case in point, Indonesian insurtech startup Qoala Qoala plans to use the funding to build-out its existing team over the next year. Besides providing coverage for five core industries including fintech and logistics, the Qoala app also supports traditional offline insurance channels, which still account for 99 percent of insurance premiums paid in the country and processes over 2 million policies a month since launching in 2019.Insurtech’s innovation doesn’t just lie within technology. Qoala struck up strategic partnerships with partners like Shopee, JD, Grabkios and Grab for merchants, and Pegipegi which used to be the Traveloka app.The meteoric rise of Qoala in a country that is traditionally slow to embrace insurance offerings is emblematic of the Singapore boasts the largest concentration of companies, including insurance plan comparison site Hong Kong has eight startups on its island alone, while insurtech firms based out of Shanghai have thus far secured the most funding, at over US$1.3 billion in total.

While Singapore is heavily regulated with over two-thirds of the population insured, insurtech startups in China and India are relatively free of government regulation, but that is changing as startups in those countries show increasing promise and development.Like China in the past, India was majorly under-served in terms of insurance penetration due to the low awareness and limited geographical reach due to the sheer size of the country.

Like many other digital solutions, they will evolve, improve, mature and eventually be developed without flaw.Despite the concerns, facial recognition can have a lot of beneficial application, whether that’s in biometric security, or improving customer experience with quick, seamless and contactless ID verification or To help organizations and AI architects develop facial recognition capabilities that are systematically ethical and reliable, the World Economic Forum (WEF) has drafted out a The practices, it hopes, can help organizations deliver facial recognition technology that is accountable for the data it collects and is ultimately free of bias.A range of products and solutions are out there, so why use facial recognition?First off, WEF urges businesses considering facial recognition to build a strong business case built to support the use of the technology, and the collection and processing of highly-sensitive personal data.Among questions that the business case must address include: What are the limitations that businesses are facing? How would facial recognition help solve the problem? How can end-users benefit from the technology deployment? What end results are the business trying to achieve?Businesses should use market data analysis and research to support their case.For instance, many airports and airline companies are quickly An organization seeking to launch facial recognition must have a clear idea of the facial features and traits that would make up the data that the technology will collect. Having sample subgroups that represent a fair variety of features would help make up datasets that can be used to train the facial recognition model.In the WEF report, it was stated: “Even when using a pre-trained model, it is important to collect a test dataset, specific to the conditions of use and the characteristics of the end-users, to evaluate the system for unfair biases.”To limit biases that the system might project, organizations must first identify the kind of ‘discrimination’ and ‘miscalculated judgments’ that the system might project in the context of the business case.Making sure that the system accounts for age, gender, race, skin tone and non-standardized facial features are key here. During the training process, it’s very important that the model is tested thoroughly and repeatedly to identify risks of biases.Some ways to improve is to revise the metrics being used to support facial scans data and recognition capabilities. Using high-quality sensors and feeding it with a rich set of data will also help.Before the technology is put in place, organizations must make it a point to deliver all the necessary information to achieve a sense of trust. End-users are mostly concerned about having their face captured and stored as data because they do not know how will organizations will really use it, or how secure it will be.In this case, it is important to maintain transparent. This would mean informing end-users of the role of facial recognition, principles that govern the design and use of the technology – in simple, intelligible terms – and lastly, the policies surrounding the data being collected, used, shared and protected.",Ethical facial recognition?

John Graham, the director of the survey told In fact, the last time such huge pessimism was recorded was back in 2008 during the Great Recession. Even then, the drop was more gradual.A similar trend of declining optimism was spotted in several other research as well. A PwC However, a week-old The current climate has forced CFOs to transform their operations almost immediately to accommodate remote working conditions. Having the right digital capabilities to support these changes and sustain financial functions across an enterprise has never been more fundamental.Digital maturity and proficiency will come up on top for these executives who have been trying to adapt to changing circumstances by remaining flexible.For those that have digitized their processes and workloads before the crisis, now is a pivotal moment to assess if what was done was ever enough.According to Genpact Chief Digital Officer (CDO), Sanjay Srivastava, this period serves as CFOs’ “first test of digitization,” in the sense that these financial leaders will now know if their transformation pursuits were strategic enough to sustain current operational dynamics.At the most foundational level of digitization, CFOs need to have data capabilities and cloud technology. These digital solutions have come up in discussions more frequently these days, further highlighting the need for a digitized financial function in the first place.Manual processes and workloads cannot thrive in a remote working environment. All forms of information have to be streamlined and recorded as data that can be shared across the financial team. Not to forget, in the absence of travel and face-to-face communication, CFOs have to make sure there is an efficient and secure way to transfer data to suppliers, buyers, partners, frontline managers, and the rest of the workforce.“Everyone is waking up to a dashboard … the old days of going into the office and walking over to a colleague’s desk [to obtain information] is over,” said Srivastava in an interview with This would then be a critical turning point for CFOs and their teams as the nature of their processes and workloads change. The CDO continued, “Old ways of disseminating information are now no longer even possible. As we get more used to the ways of working, it’s unlikely we’ll ever return to the same environment.Having data streamlined would also mean that CFOs are able to pool insights using readily available analytical tools. In such uncertain times, CFOs and financial teams need would desperately need to rely on data analytics and insights to drive better decisions and improve budget planning.“It drives a need for scenario planning and outcome modeling at an almost unprecedented level. Once you have the data, your colleagues’ need for insights and modeling capabilities will grow exponentially.”The It wouldn’t be a surprise if a lot of these financial leaders are finding on-premise infrastructure unfit for remote operations. In fact, from Srivastava’s experience, a lot of CFOs have reported suffering a tremendous decline in productivity as current IT capabilities are unable to support increasing workloads, thus creating greater forms of laggards.Cloud is, without a doubt, not a luxury of the office but instead, a critical component in bolstering the finance function and preparing CFO teams for the future of work.“What makes this kind of technology relevant is the contextual knowledge and understanding of how it can help the finance function. This is the opportunity for CFOs to embrace, and get involved, and define the shape of digital technology.”It shouldn’t have taken a pandemic for CFOs to realize that but that is the reality of the current situation. What’s important now is for CFOs to focus on adopting these foundational digital capabilities to help the company survive more unprecedented circumstances to come.",CFOs could ‘define the shape’ of digital technology in 2020,https://techwireasia.com/2020/04/cfos-could-define-the-shape-of-digital-technology-in-2020/,20 April 2020

By entering the store you consent to facial recognition cameras capturing and storing your image.”Despite the language used in the signage, the 7-Eleven spokesperson insists that the facial recognition tech is only activated when customers use the Rate It tablet, and the data is not being used for any other purpose.

Walmart filed a patent in March 2018 which described a method to track shoppers’ movements around stores in a variety of ways, including via facial recognition to analyze customers’ moods.

TikTok’s popularity has been so meteoric among 16-to-24-year-olds that it’s attracted marketing spend from brands such as eBay, Zalora, Kia, Maybelline, and Puma began recognizing the platform as a powerful tool to reach a millennial audience.Recognizing its “TikTok’s immersive, short-form videos give businesses a platform to participate and engage with a community known for its creativity, ingenuity, and joy,” is how Chew Wee Ng, TikTok’s Head of Business Marketing for Southeast Asia, describes the platform.Brands and SMBs can engage TikTok’s influential group of content creators in the Despite its popularity among the youth market and the increasing stack of marketing options, the app owned by Chinese firm ByteDance is US lawmakers first pointed to TikTok as a potential spying and data gathering tool for the Chinese government, and there are even hints from the Trump Administration of a national ban on the app, while the European Union is also forming an investigative task force to examine TikTok’s data collection and its security and privacy risks. One Australian senator accused TikTok of being “a data collection service disguised as social media.”Concerns lie in the fact that Chinese technology companies are required by law to provide the information they obtain, or information stored on their networks to Chinese authorities if requested. An official from the United States’ Office of the Director of National Intelligence told TikTok has made efforts to distance itself from its parent company ByteDance and any ties to the Chinese PLO government. The app claims to have addressed many of the privacy and security loopholes floated regarding its commercial app, and said in a However, TikTok has also been accused of censorship. This stems back to an article in The Guardian in September 2019, when leaked documents showed TikTok instructing moderators to This investigation followed the In light of the With such heavy scrutiny leveled at its China ties, parent company ByteDance is once again The popular app has already made some changes such as appointing Los Angeles-based former Disney exec Kevin Mayer as the new Chief Executive Officer, replacing China-based Alex Zhu. The company has also been hiring talent in Washington to lobby policymakers and is setting up ‘transparency centers’, which will offer concerned parties with a look inside the app, by the end of this year.TikTok For Business’ privacy policyWhile the policy is upfront about the user and business tracking data it will collate, it is vague on how long TikTok will store (and make use of) that information, saying only that it will keep the data for as long as “our contractual obligations and rights in relation to the information involved.”If users want to cancel their TikTok for Business account, the privacy policy states it will still store your data, but in “an aggregated and anonymized format.”TikTok For Business has varying privacy rights specifically stated for the US state of California, the European Union, and India, in line with regional data privacy regulations in operation. The EU and India portion, for example, permits users to “ask us [TikTok] to delete” their stored data, due to tougher regulations under the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and India’s recently tightened data-privacy laws. For California, users can request to obtain “a list of third parties to whom we may disclose personal data for marketing purposes” but deleting of stored data is omitted, and so is the part about “anonymizing” stored information once the user terminates their service.Storage of collected data is said to be stored “in the United States with backup redundancy in Singapore,” according to the company’s blog post that disputes the government spying claims, stating emphatically, “TikTok does not remove content based on sensitivities related to China. We have never been asked by the Chinese government to remove any content and we would not do so if asked. Period.”There is no sufficient evidence that data has been misused by TikTok or, indeed, shared with the Chinese government, and therefore, no reason why a company’s data would be at risk when using TikTok for Business. As with any other social media marketing platform, by using the service businesses must make their own judgments in line with the privacy information outlined by the company, and the extent and nature to which the company is willing to share data with tech giants, who aren’t immune from breaches themselves.It is also up to the individual business about how much merit they give earlier reports of censorship, and whether TikTok’s departure from Hong Kong in light of invasive new privacy laws is enough to convince them that the company’s standing on the matter is in line with their own.For now, TikTok remains as one of the most effective means of targeting a young, engaged audience – some may wish to take advantage of that while it’s a certainty.",Is TikTok For Business safe for your business?,https://techwireasia.com/2020/07/is-tiktok-for-business-safe-for-your-business/,10 July 2020

A new scam targeting Wells Fargo customers demonstrates the evermore creative approaches cyberattackers are turning to. Some 15,000 customers of US multinational financial services giant Wells Fargo – which employs more than 260,000 employees across 7,400 locations globally – were targeted by a phishing campaign impersonating the Wells Fargo Security, luring victims into phishing pages with calendar invites. According to researchers at Abnormal Security, messages include .ics calendar file attachments containing events directing the recipients to phishing pages. The messages claimed customers must update their security keys using the instructions included in the calendar attachment, or have their accounts suspended. On a fake Wells Fargo page, users are prompted to enter sensitive information such as username, password, pin and account number. The scam is particularly clever as it encourages users to open the message on a smartphone, where the .ics file can automatically be added to their calendar. The victim subsequently receives a calendar event notification from their trusted app, which they are more likely to click. If the user falls for the scam and submits all their details, the attackers would have all the information they need to take control of targets’ accounts, steal their identity and money. Not a bad day’s work. Last year, scammers targeted Another clever scam from last year saw phishers using malicious customers 404 pages to serve phishing sites. 404 pages tell users when they’ve hit a broken or dead link. Targeting Microsoft, the attackers included links that pointed to non-existent pages, and when Microsoft security systems scanned the link, they’d receive the 404 error and deem the link safe. But if a real user accessed the same URL, the phishing site would detect the user and redirect them to an actual phishing page, instead of the server’s 404 error page. As phishing scams continue to change shape, they will more easily slip through the net: ",Wells Fargo phishing campaign shows threat continues to evolve,https://techwireasia.com/2020/06/wells-fargo-phishing-campaign-shows-threat-continues-to-evolve/,24 June 2020

This sort of statistical analysis has become commonplace in the Indian subcontinent in the past few months, and the Indian public who were used to receiving ‘Good Morning’ memes and forwarded messages in their WhatsApp chat groups (India has by far the biggest number of WhatsApp users in the world) now instead wake up to data infographics showing the latest updates surrounding the outbreak in their country.COVID-19 has changed the ways that Indians live their lives in various aspects, one of which is the newfound understanding and acceptance of data sets among the public. No longer just considered lines on a histogram, the average urban Indian has now become adept at following data-driven trends surrounding the pandemic, and terms such as ‘infection rates’, ‘mortality rates’, ‘flattening the curve’, and ‘exponential growth curve’ have all become standard terms in the lexicon of everyday conversation.In fact, much like other parts of the world, charts and data concepts have become the defacto method of imparting information related to the coronavirus and ongoing efforts to stem its deadly effects. For example, graphs showing COVID-19 infection rates, overlaid with the known healthcare capacity of an affected region, help the public to understand and grasp how social distancing and contact tracing measures can help limit outbreaks of new infections.The use of big data is by no means new in the country, with Data analytics does not require assembling resource-intensive, data-collection methods like surveys to gather information on the expansive region. Instead, data can work with artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to run predictive models that can generate data digitally, and then be automatically compiled and analyzed in real-time – yielding faster, actionable data that organizations and businesses can use to inform other operational decision-making.Using agriculture as an example, big data could help study crop growth patterns, analyzing the best times to plant that would yield the highest crop production, study weather and seasonal patterns to determine best planting times, and so forth.The relevance of data, especially when paired with other technologies like AI, fast connectivity like 5G, and IoT-connected devices such as sensors to optimize data-gathering, has been With the critical functions that data analytics plays now plain to as a result of COVID-19 graphs and charts, both Indian organizations and civil services need to step up their utilization of valuable data resources at scale.As the country slowly begins to show signs of recovery, India should take note and perhaps prioritize ",How the pandemic made big data mainstream in India,https://techwireasia.com/2020/06/how-the-pandemic-made-big-data-mainstream-in-india/,17 June 2020

Mainly, that more than one study has shown that These uncertainties give room for pause, especially for large, multinational organizations in Japan such as Softbank Corp, which hires over 1,000 individuals each year, and has trained its recruitment AI based on data from 1,500 past CVs.SoftBank’s director of recruitment, Tomoko Sugihara, told “Extra time that has been created thanks to AI allows recruiters more time to proactively engage with potential candidates in person, build relationships and carefully determine the candidates’ culture fit,” Sugihara said. “We of course cannot rely on AI for all the processes but making it learn our recruiting policies and standards for what kind of person we are looking for based on past data has helped us gain objectivity and uniformity in our hiring process.”AI-powered chatbots and video analysis software are also becoming recruitment techniques used by Japanese conglomerates in the initial stages of sorting, ranking, and shortlisting candidates. Data from past successful/unsuccessful applicants can be used to train AIs as to what a particular company is looking for from a new recruit.Tapping the power of AI for recruitment is A professor at Business Breakthrough University, Shinji Kawakami, says that Japanese companies are increasingly using AI to collect and analyze vast sums of candidate data that they receive during springtime – which is when Japanese tradition dictates that fresh graduates will be hired in droves, each business year.“[The companies] began to think it’s a waste not to use human resources data collected over the years,” Kawakami said. “They also want to make more accurate decisions in hiring as the interviewers’ decisions, influenced by his or her dislikes and likes, cannot always be trusted.”The data can also be used to standardize the pairing job requirements with particular candidate traits like experience and skillsets, which Kawakami says can lead to hiring the right, productive staff that will possess loyalty for the company – traits that are also highly sought after by Japanese firms.But observers believe that using AI to narrow down job applicants requires meticulous selection of comparison data to avoid discriminatory biases, many of which might be unintentionally picked up on by the AI. The selected data also needs to be regularly tested against the outcomes, to ensure the expected hiring objectives are being matched.“It is important that the system is monitored all the time and the model is reviewed continuously. Keeping and sharing a document which records information such as the intended use, training data and evaluation factors is useful,” says Toshihiro Kamishima, a senior researcher at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology. “The key is always to be able to fix the problem when it occurs.”",Japanese firms testing if AI in recruitment is the way to go,https://techwireasia.com/2020/06/japanese-firms-testing-if-ai-in-recruitment-is-the-way-to-go/,25 June 2020

Vulnerabilities can surface as basic security, such as patching and updates, are delayed or neglected by overstrained IT teams.”The rapid shift towards remote working processes and now to even-more-recent ‘new normal’ work arrangements both in the office and outside, might have resulted in even more cybersecurity gaps that the beleaguered IT professionals will have to take note of. “As a result, the major changes in IT infrastructure and digital environment can potentially create new attack surfaces or broadening existing ones for threat actors to exploit, especially if organizations do not adopt a secure-by-design approach,” noted Lee.With a secure-by-design approach, cybersecurity experts say organizations can minimize systems vulnerabilities and reduce the attack surface through designing and building security in every phase of their digital systems’ design, development, and implementation. As organizations move to rapidly expand their remote working capabilities and infrastructure, they will be building it on a more secure digital foundation.Ensign InfoSecurity’s SVP Lee recommends that “cybersecurity teams should be involved at every step of the process or the organizations might risk spending a lot more time and resources remediating and recovering from security incidents that could have been mitigated or more easily addressed if proper cybersecurity measures are in place.”Thailand, Singapore, and Malaysia were identified as the most attractive targets for hackers in APAC, with companies in Singapore and Thailand likely to suffer the most financially as a result of a cyber-breach, the Cisco study found.And Ensign’s Singapore Threat Landscape report found that the high technology sector – including such digital companies like cloud, data center, and web hosting service providers – as the vertical most targeted in Singapore by threat actors in 2019. “The reason why threat actors are focused on high technology companies is to exploit their data center infrastructure and target the data of other organizations whose servers are being hosted there,” warned Lee.“The high technology sector plays a vital role in Singapore technology-driven economy and it will continue to be a critical engine for our economy in the post-COVID-19 world as remote working becomes the new normal, leading to an increase in cloud adoption and data center demands.

For the rest, the urgency to engage and advance digital transformation strategies has been kicked up a notch.Even at the most basic level, cloud-based tools such as Zoom and Teams have kept workforces in touch and productive from their respective homes. Elsewhere, AI-powered chatbots have bolstered overburdened customer service divisions, automation technologies have allowed smaller teams to reallocate limited resources, and advanced cybersecurity solutions are ensuring distributed workforces are protected. Technology has played a leading role in enabling businesses to continue to operate. As the significance of that has been placed center-stage, there’s now little doubt among businesses that investing in digital is the only way to both survive the fallout, and remain competitive going forward. But as the world of business enters into a period of economic uncertainty and faces a “cash crunch”, many companies are unconfident they have the funds secured to back investments in new technology. That’s according to a new report by HFS Research and KPMG dubbed Nearly 60% of respondents agree that COVID-19 has created a drive to accelerate digital transformation, but just 13% expect to increase investment in emerging tech as a result. Business objectives are, for now, focused on survival, and that means ensuring work from home arrangements are functioning as a more viable permanent solution, automation tools are in place, and opportunities are taken to crowdsource talent from a wider pool of remote candidates. On the other hand, objectives like growth, acquisitions to entering new markets, making cultural changes, and reskilling and training have taken more of a backseat. Since the full force of the pandemic was realized, the perception of importance in investments into emerging technologies — including AI, hybrid and multi-cloud, smart analytics and process automation — has shifted away from cost reduction, improved decision-making ability, and improved brand value. Instead, investments here are considered “essential for future survival” across the board. With much more at stake from their limited budgets, businesses must focus on mature “have-to-have” technologies, said HFS, such as cloud, automation, and analytics, that may drive quicker ROI. On the other hand, more nascent technologies like edge computing, blockchain, AI, and 5G have seen budgets pulled back by more than 50% in most cases. Hybrid and multi-cloud investments are regarded as perhaps the most important post-COVID investments, but the value of automation is also seeing an uptick in technologies like Business Process Management software, Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and Work from home arrangements — and the increased vulnerabilities of multiple endpoints and BYOD usage — has meanwhile led cybersecurity to become a “c-level mandate”. With the exception of process automation, which more than a third of companies claim to have seen immediate value from, the added pressure to invest in the technology “essentials” comes with the fact the majority believe they won’t see significant value for at least 1-2 years. Ensuring this technology is onboarded as soon as possible, then, is crucial. Even among the “have-to-have” technologies, however, there are challenges in realizing value in investments towards digital transformation. Post-COVID, leaders report that making the business case for investments and securing buy-in from the C-Suite have become some of the hardest tasks. Ahead of the pandemic, businesses considered overcoming the organizational cultural changes the biggest potential roadblock, but this has become much less of a concern today.If there’s a silver lining to all the talk of tight purse strings, it’s that the majority IT buyers expect to be ramping up their spending once again within the next year.

Perhaps it should come as little surprise then that industrious startups around the region are constantly looking at ways to complement age-old farming practices with modern agritech, that can boost crop yields while reducing risks and inefficiencies for farmers.Agritech (agriculture technology) solutions have sprouted up across the continent to try and coax sustainable growth, but there is not one definitive system or methodology that can be applied to easily automate farm work, as planting and harvesting crops are subject to a variety of factors including rain fall, environmental factors, planting criteria, available machinery, and so forth.In addition, the growing issue of food security is also drawing attention to the last of sustainable agricultural practices in the region. FAO’s There have been a number of Some, like Others, like international robotics firm FJ Dynamics, had focused on artificial intelligence (AI), advanced smart manufacturing applications, and developing new energy capacities. The company which has R&D facilities in China, the Netherlands and Sweden is now supplementing its existing skills with data, digital modelling, and automation toolkits that can have a transformative impact on farming practices in Asia.Most of FJ Dynamics’ agritech solutions are anchored by data. The firm taps Microsoft Azure to retrieve and store vast swaths of precision data, and this is integrated with the Microsoft Azure Intelligent Cloud Platform to provide an IoT platform where autonomous vehicles affixed with sensors can collect and analyze data.Furthermore, FJ Dynamics has a range of fully autonomous agritech vehicles including automated tractors, harvesters, and rice transplanters that not only transmit IoT data, but can have their harvest route mapped out digitally. This 3D model can be used to control the rice transplanter for instance, not in the route it takes, but also the dispersal of fertilizer and measuring soil nutrient levels using its sensors and onboard equipment.“Once you set up a 3D model of the farm, you don’t need to modify it until you do some modification or construction work that alters the plot,” These smart vehicles also harness the advantages of data to schedule the daily, weekly, and seasonal tasks necessary to keep a working farm operating. An example would be using past planting season’s data to inform this year’s planting schedule, right down to spraying the exact amount of pesticides and herbicides required – reducing time and wastage on chemicals and other resources.Farmers in China claim that FJ’s smart robots have helped to improve efficiency by 10%. “Since these autonomous agriculture robots can work for 24 hours, it helps reduce the time I spent laboring out in the harsh conditions of the field,” one farmer commented.IoT-enabled agritech is really proving to be important towards accomplishing sustainable farming goals, as can be seen in this Elsewhere, a Malaysian industrial drone maker is providing ",How agritech driven by data is modernizing farming in Asia,https://techwireasia.com/2020/08/how-agritech-driven-by-data-is-modernizing-farming-in-asia/,11 August 2020

The government also released the app’s source code, so the public could confirm what the data is being used for – but Finally, users can delete the app off their device.

This technology is proving incredibly powerful and is fast advancing and gaining momentum rapidly across various use cases and industries.By understanding, analyzing, and extracting meaningful data from images faster and more accurately than humans, computer vision’s use cases span often controversial use in anything from facial recognition systems to identifying hairline flaws in manufacturing and identifying anomalies from MRI scans.Computer vision is also fundamental to the development of cutting-edge robotics, including autonomous vehicles and drones, that can ‘see’ and act on their surroundings. In short, the technology is enabling technologists to push new boundaries across a massive expanse of sectors, such as defense, manufacturing, retail, insurance, and retail.Here are some of the more interesting use cases of computer vision currently at play:Use of computer vision with CCTV systems may be unnerving and, in some cases, plain controversial. A number of tech giants, including IBM, have publicly backed away from offering its technology to law enforcement, But computer vision used in surveillance systems isn’t just about spying on citizens or holding criminals to account. Construction sites can employ the technology to identify when workers or vehicles are straying into dangerous, off-limit zones, sounding an alert to the individual on the ground, or even sending a signal that shuts off machinery.Computer vision also has the ability to ensure safety at large and crowded public events, such as identifying a risk of overcrowding, and triggering digital displays with prompts to move back, or signposting to areas of more space.At the Roland Garros tennis tournament in Paris this year, mobile operator Orange piloted use of real-time analysis of CCTV images using CV to enable staff to guide visitors to their seats, reducing the risks of overcrowding and improving the sports fans’ visitor experience.In these types of scenarios, edge computing enables both near real-time response, but also privacy, with images being processed locally on a private network on site.Downtime is a sin in manufacturing, and that puts the sector on a constant quest to employ technologies that speed up time-to-market while ensuring quality is optimized. Computer vision can remove and far out-perform the role of humans from the process of quality control, adding accuracy and repeatability to what is otherwise a monotonous task.Every successful manufacturer will have a rigorous quality control process in place but in certain highly-regulated industries, such as Aviation, Space, and Defense Industry, the stakes of a flaw in a product can risk not just reputation but could pose a serious threat to human lives. 3D-enabled computer vision systems can identify the smallest defect in a component that the human eye might miss.Even in the pharmaceutical industry, computer vision is being used to detect and analyze bacterial growth in Petri dishes containing samples of vaccines in production. This is proving a more accurate and effective alternative human inspection in detecting production problems and ultimately can bring medicines and vaccines into circulation faster.Optical character recognition (OCR) is another subset of computer vision that can identify characters from handwritten, typed, or printed text and turn it into machine-readable text. This can transform data-entry tasks where masses of data in disparate formats is collected and must be decoded constantly.OCR has replaced the need, in many cases, for humans to scour through and manually index scanned paper documents.If an insurance company is receiving more than 20 million documents a day, for example — a large volume of which could be emergencies which would require urgent attention — OCR can identify data while Another application of OCR is in extracting valuable, forgotten information from banks of legacy data that organizations may have generated over decades. The found data can subsequently be used by artificial intelligence and machine learning systems to make predictions. It may also be used to paw through medical records in efforts to uncover recurring cases of illnesses for example.",Computer vision — three exciting ways it’s changing business,https://techwireasia.com/2020/08/computer-vision-three-exciting-ways-its-changing-business/,27 August 2020

It now needs to be online, available at any time, and it needs to be fast.Messengers are proving valuable channels to support customers in a way that is natural to them. The approach can enable customer service teams to deliver fast, friendly and personal support. But to cater for a higher volume of support requests, many businesses are turning to chatbots and automation technology.Well-designed chatbots are the key to scaling conversational support, but there’s a lot of debate around what makes a good chatbot. Many guides advise starting by designing a ‘persona’ for your bot — find a cute avatar that’s on brand, choose a name, maybe teach it some witty banter. This can be a big-time investment, and should actually be bottom of the list. The customer isn’t looking for a chatbot to be their friend. It’s much more important whether the bot can actually give them the information they need — and it should stay out of the way if it can’t.Great bots start with a set of principles. Good principles serve as an enduring foundation for decisions, allowing the focus to stay on the customer experience. Chatbots have shown huge promise for resolving support issues from the beginning: customers save time, and businesses save money — a clear win-win. But the sticky spot is designing bots that There are a few ways to avoid this. First, set expectations with customers. It’s a bad start when a bot says something as general as “Hi, what can I help you with today?”, as very few bots can help Instead, the bot should give hints as to what it If your platform supports it, the bot should quickly assess how likely it is that the user’s query can be resolved by an automated system. Bots are most helpful when it comes to common, simple queries that don’t require the bot to develop an understanding of complex issues. A good bot will proactively funnel complex, long-tail issues over to your human support team. If the bot can’t help, it should let the customer know early, and explicitly excuse itself. If customer support isn’t available, redirecting a customer to a help center is preferable to getting stuck going round-and-round with a bot that knows it can’t actually help you.Nothing leads to worse customer experience than someone feeling like they’re trapped in support jail. A well-designed bot will let customers exit at any time, even if there isn’t a human to talk to. Don’t be tempted to keep customers in the bot flow because you don’t have enough human support resources. Trapping the customer without a place to go, or building a navigation flow without a clear exit, is not good for the customer experience. Bad experiences lead to frustration, negative word-of-mouth, and an unwillingness to later engage with self-serve content that The best way to allow customers to exit the bot depends on context. The most obvious solution is to have an always-present button that lets the customer exit. But some less obvious features will work just as well. Consider designing your bot to say one thing and then stop unless spoken to again, or to bow out if a user ignores its prompts. This lets customers exit by default. You can also design your bot to recognize exit syntax — words like “exit” or “quit” or “go away” — that a customer may say. The end goal is to make it easy for a customer to leave the conversation if they need to — the responsibility lies with the business to facilitate this.Customer relationships are the cornerstone of business success, and you can’t build great customer relationships without great experiences and personal communication. The “personal” generally means communication that feels friendly, easy, and quick. From a technical standpoint, this means bots should have no artificial loading delays and no walls of text. Customers also shouldn’t have to hunt for answers through an endless tree or be encouraged to stay in a support interaction that can’t help them. If your bot has certain flows that some customers must follow to progress their request — for example, if the customer must answer questions about their company before talking to sales, or enter their product make and model before accessing technical support—these flows shouldn’t be triggered until they are needed. Don’t frontload them automatically to customers they aren’t relevant for. Similarly, if customers are sometimes required to grant privacy permissions, or authenticate, the bot should prompt for these only as needed.HOW CHATBOTS ARE MAKING BANKING MORE CONVERSATIONALThe impact of each individual delay is small, but taken together will add up to a support experience that feels either fast and respectful, or frustrating and uncaring. Customers will notice when this principle is followed: they’ve been jaded by waiting on hold while a voice tells them how much ‘their time is respected,’ so businesses that actually do follow this principle stand out.If you’re looking to design or use chatbots to improve your customer support, the best place to start is with customer-centric design principles.

This technology is proving incredibly powerful and is fast advancing and gaining momentum rapidly across various use cases and industries.By understanding, analyzing, and extracting meaningful data from images faster and more accurately than humans, computer vision’s use cases span often controversial use in anything from facial recognition systems to identifying hairline flaws in manufacturing and identifying anomalies from MRI scans.Computer vision is also fundamental to the development of cutting-edge robotics, including autonomous vehicles and drones, that can ‘see’ and act on their surroundings. In short, the technology is enabling technologists to push new boundaries across a massive expanse of sectors, such as defense, manufacturing, retail, insurance, and retail.Here are some of the more interesting use cases of computer vision currently at play:Use of computer vision with CCTV systems may be unnerving and, in some cases, plain controversial. A number of tech giants, including IBM, have publicly backed away from offering its technology to law enforcement, But computer vision used in surveillance systems isn’t just about spying on citizens or holding criminals to account. Construction sites can employ the technology to identify when workers or vehicles are straying into dangerous, off-limit zones, sounding an alert to the individual on the ground, or even sending a signal that shuts off machinery.Computer vision also has the ability to ensure safety at large and crowded public events, such as identifying a risk of overcrowding, and triggering digital displays with prompts to move back, or signposting to areas of more space.At the Roland Garros tennis tournament in Paris this year, mobile operator Orange piloted use of real-time analysis of CCTV images using CV to enable staff to guide visitors to their seats, reducing the risks of overcrowding and improving the sports fans’ visitor experience.In these types of scenarios, edge computing enables both near real-time response, but also privacy, with images being processed locally on a private network on site.Downtime is a sin in manufacturing, and that puts the sector on a constant quest to employ technologies that speed up time-to-market while ensuring quality is optimized. Computer vision can remove and far out-perform the role of humans from the process of quality control, adding accuracy and repeatability to what is otherwise a monotonous task.Every successful manufacturer will have a rigorous quality control process in place but in certain highly-regulated industries, such as Aviation, Space, and Defense Industry, the stakes of a flaw in a product can risk not just reputation but could pose a serious threat to human lives. 3D-enabled computer vision systems can identify the smallest defect in a component that the human eye might miss.Even in the pharmaceutical industry, computer vision is being used to detect and analyze bacterial growth in Petri dishes containing samples of vaccines in production. This is proving a more accurate and effective alternative human inspection in detecting production problems and ultimately can bring medicines and vaccines into circulation faster.Optical character recognition (OCR) is another subset of computer vision that can identify characters from handwritten, typed, or printed text and turn it into machine-readable text. This can transform data-entry tasks where masses of data in disparate formats is collected and must be decoded constantly.OCR has replaced the need, in many cases, for humans to scour through and manually index scanned paper documents.If an insurance company is receiving more than 20 million documents a day, for example — a large volume of which could be emergencies which would require urgent attention — OCR can identify data while Another application of OCR is in extracting valuable, forgotten information from banks of legacy data that organizations may have generated over decades. The found data can subsequently be used by artificial intelligence and machine learning systems to make predictions. It may also be used to paw through medical records in efforts to uncover recurring cases of illnesses for example.",Computer vision — three exciting ways it’s changing business,https://techwireasia.com/2020/08/computer-vision-three-exciting-ways-its-changing-business/,27 August 2020

To create a common data environment, MRT Corp turned to The partners are able to better leverage cloud-hosted services, making use of Bentley’s information management and collaboration platform ProjectWise, along with AssetWise, a software for managing accurate information funnels, ensuring accurate delivery and proper change management protocols.All of the Bentley software is hosted on Microsoft’s Azure, enabling upwards of 1,500 users to work together on around 7,500 digital models and more than 280,000 documents and drawings, equivalent to 2.3 terabytes of project data.“The Azure-hosted Bentley Systems platform enabled MRT Corp to increase precision of construction, reduce instances of design rework and to improve safety standards by enabling seamless synchronization and information exchange between external vendors. It has enabled all project disciplines to work dynamically using a federated model for coordinated design, despite the participation of numerous external vendors and decentralized information on this complex project,” read a MRT Corp director of planning and design Poh Seng Tiok said in the statement: “One of the key challenges faced with any mega civil construction project like ours is ensuring seamless information exchange, and real-time collaboration among stakeholders, regardless of the platforms they are using.”“The probability for error is high if information is not managed on a common data environment, especially in a highly collaborative project like ours.

It now needs to be online, available at any time, and it needs to be fast.Messengers are proving valuable channels to support customers in a way that is natural to them. The approach can enable customer service teams to deliver fast, friendly and personal support. But to cater for a higher volume of support requests, many businesses are turning to chatbots and automation technology.Well-designed chatbots are the key to scaling conversational support, but there’s a lot of debate around what makes a good chatbot. Many guides advise starting by designing a ‘persona’ for your bot — find a cute avatar that’s on brand, choose a name, maybe teach it some witty banter. This can be a big-time investment, and should actually be bottom of the list. The customer isn’t looking for a chatbot to be their friend. It’s much more important whether the bot can actually give them the information they need — and it should stay out of the way if it can’t.Great bots start with a set of principles. Good principles serve as an enduring foundation for decisions, allowing the focus to stay on the customer experience. Chatbots have shown huge promise for resolving support issues from the beginning: customers save time, and businesses save money — a clear win-win. But the sticky spot is designing bots that There are a few ways to avoid this. First, set expectations with customers. It’s a bad start when a bot says something as general as “Hi, what can I help you with today?”, as very few bots can help Instead, the bot should give hints as to what it If your platform supports it, the bot should quickly assess how likely it is that the user’s query can be resolved by an automated system. Bots are most helpful when it comes to common, simple queries that don’t require the bot to develop an understanding of complex issues. A good bot will proactively funnel complex, long-tail issues over to your human support team. If the bot can’t help, it should let the customer know early, and explicitly excuse itself.

South Korea was also the Japan only started rolling out 5G infrastructure earlier this year, but it does have the highest 4G availability. Japanese residents are predominantly connected to 4G networks (98.5%), and their superior network speeds highlight an important distinction that those outside the telecommunications sector might be unaware of: 4G and 5G standards are Other nations that now have 5G and have an average downlink throughput of above 40 Mbps are Norway, Australia, and Switzerland. Interestingly, despite only just introducing its 5G network, Canada is already seeing download speeds on par with South Korea, both coming in at a benchmark-setting 59 Mbps – 50% faster than their fellow G7 nations France, Germany, Italy, UK, and the US.In terms of top mobile network experience in APAC cities, Hong Kong came out ahead of South Korea’s Seoul and Singapore, which is not introducing 5G standalone networks this year. Hong Kong and Seoul are already running non-standalone 5G access, along with Taiwan’s Taipei and Japan’s Tokyo that came in fourth and fifth, respectively, in terms of network experience.The study also analyzed connectivity’s impact on video experience, using a point scale between zero and 100 to measure video experience quality – a score of 75 and above qualified as “excellent video experience” while a score between 65 and 74 equaled “very good video experience”. Here, four countries (the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Austria, and Norway) all tied for first place, while The report’s findings highlight that 5G-ready countries experienced better download speeds by 24.9% than their counterparts that haven’t introduced the standard, but they make up a minuscule proportion of users.

Others still are reconnecting disrupted supply chains, or getting back in touch with salespeople or business partners located in different towns or countries altogether.One thing all companies have in common is that remaining reliably connected will be integral to resuming some semblance of regular working arrangements.Here in Asia, where the uneven distribution of communications tools is a rule rather than an exception, telecommunications service providers have proven invaluable, not only in helping enterprises stay connected in spite of new work requirements, but in pushing the quality of digitalized services and offerings in a shorter time span, to meet mounting customer needs.Tata Communications last month announced that its Asia Direct Cable (ADC) Consortium is building a high-performance submarine cable connecting China (Hong Kong SAR and Guangdong Province), Japan, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.The firm was one of the early initiators of the ADC, and its high capacity optical fibers can carry 140 Tbps of traffic, enabling high capacity transmission of data across the East Asian and Southeast Asian regions, and supplying an additional route to connect with Tata Communications’ existing global network.Tech Wire AsiaTata Communications sees itself as a “Data is the new currency, the new oil… we can confidently say that 90% of the data that we see today was created in the past two years, because that is the rate at which we are accelerating on the creation of data,” said Srinivasan, commenting on the quicker pace of today’s data-driven intelligent systems.Tata Communications’ data insights are driven by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), and Srinivasan says these data analytics tools will be indispensable for enterprises looking to scale up their operations. “Because that will ensure the analytics is useful for the company to scale, by actually using algorithms that are smarter, that are faster, and can do the work consistently and self-learn – that’s where the scalability of the data will come from.”“I call those technologies the new members or new employees of every team. Because they need to be embraced, they need to be accepted, they need to be trained as you would do with any new employee,” he said.Tata Communications Next-generation tech advancements like cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT) enabled connectivity, and AI are being increasingly embraced by organizations as they pivot towards digitalizing their systems and processes.

Taiwan’s most prolific manufacturer, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), recently severed its long-running ties with China’s 5G equipment market leader Huawei Technologies, following fresh American trade restrictions that explicitly prohibit the US and its allies from supplying Huawei with valuable tech components.TSMC’s decision to discontinue its Huawei relationship, combined with its“We would call these American values.

Both popular retail chains’ web services were brutalized by users on The scathing reviews were unsettling for Australia’s most well-known store chain – in a bid to modernize, David Jones had been posting significant web sales increases over the past two years as the company turned towards a more digital shopping experience.“Whilst our stores remained open during the lockdown, our online store sales doubled. This sales growth, coupled with dispatch and delivery delays associated with the increased volumes, led to unprecedented demands on the customer services teams,” said Daniele Iezzi, the customer services general manager at David Jones and Country Road Group“We saw increases of up to 500% in customer contact. Call volumes increased so quickly that at one stage customers were telephoning us every two seconds. Needless to say, wait times for calls ballooned out to levels we weren’t comfortable with.”Gartner reportsFor David Jones Australia, the company has decided to support its growing online sales by moving its maligned customer service operations to run on Amazon Connect and Salesforce cloud-based systems, to better manage customer feedback and ensure customer fulfillment is taking priority.Customer services GM Iezzi told “This placed pressure on the customer services team. The increase in online sales drove a 50% growth in phone calls to the team with the main inquiry being related to order status,” explained Iezzi. “Coupled with outdated systems, this demand was creating an experience that didn’t live up to our customers’ expectations.”David Jones decided to retain its customer relationship services in-house rather than outsourcing them, allowing the company to have a more direct grasp of their customers’ expectations, and brought in Deloitte to build a new platform based on Amazon Connect and Salesforce’s Service Cloud.Salesforce has repeatedly been ranked as one of the top customer service and support software vendors, with David Jones Australia is also using Amazon Connect’s “If you’re ringing to check on the status of your order, Amazon Connect will locate the order in your Salesforce profile, confirm its details with you, and then [make] an API call to our order management system and to our delivery partners [to] relay the order status to you, without the need for human intervention,” he continued. “This is really powerful as order status inquiries are still the main source of customer contacts to our team.”For out-of-hours calls, the system will create an ‘unresolved case’ in Service Cloud, filling in the details and reason for the call automatically. Amazon Connect can also determine to transfer calls to an agent, by looking at the customer’s profile info in Salesforce, identifying the caller by their phone number.The digital customer care platform has provided David Jones some of the space to pivot to additional support channels, such as transitioning store staff who were not working much during the lockdown, and redeploying them to handle excess online queries.“One of the great features of Amazon Connect and Service Cloud is the flexibility to scale up quite easily,” noted GM Iezzi. “As a result, we could redeploy these team members quickly using their own devices, and we could call on team members from any state to work with us remotely. They were able to hit the ground running.”In addition, David Jones Australia also increased its live chat and chatbot capacities, including using chatbots to better understand customer intent early and to obtain necessary customer information “such as their name, a case number or product information, helped reduce our handling time, and increase agent productivity in chat.”Iezzi says the capabilities of Amazon Connect and Salesforce allowed the retailer to keep “every channel of communication open” despite customer care agents undergoing the transition to work-from-home during Australia’s lockdown period.Buoyed by the recent customer response improvements, David Jones plans to identify opportunities “to automate further customer intents so that we can deflect more calls away from the customer services team.”“As we continue to leverage the power of Amazon Connect used in conjunction with Service Cloud, we will continue to gather information and insights about our customers, as each contact creates a case in the customer’s profile in Salesforce,” said Iezzi.David Jones is also planning to provide better tools to supplement the customer’s in-store experiences as well. “We’re looking to implement chat and messaging in-store,” Iezzi confirmed. “This will give customers more options in how they’d like to engage with our store teams, and allow sales assistants to view their customer’s shopping history, allowing them to sell the right product more easily and more efficiently. Naturally, this will be integrated with Service Cloud.”",Why Aussie department store David Jones went cloudwards for CX,https://techwireasia.com/2020/07/why-aussie-department-store-david-jones-went-cloudwards-for-cx/,23 July 2020

Others still are reconnecting disrupted supply chains, or getting back in touch with salespeople or business partners located in different towns or countries altogether.One thing all companies have in common is that remaining reliably connected will be integral to resuming some semblance of regular working arrangements.Here in Asia, where the uneven distribution of communications tools is a rule rather than an exception, telecommunications service providers have proven invaluable, not only in helping enterprises stay connected in spite of new work requirements, but in pushing the quality of digitalized services and offerings in a shorter time span, to meet mounting customer needs.Tata Communications last month announced that its Asia Direct Cable (ADC) Consortium is building a high-performance submarine cable connecting China (Hong Kong SAR and Guangdong Province), Japan, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.The firm was one of the early initiators of the ADC, and its high capacity optical fibers can carry 140 Tbps of traffic, enabling high capacity transmission of data across the East Asian and Southeast Asian regions, and supplying an additional route to connect with Tata Communications’ existing global network.Tech Wire AsiaTata Communications sees itself as a “Data is the new currency, the new oil… we can confidently say that 90% of the data that we see today was created in the past two years, because that is the rate at which we are accelerating on the creation of data,” said Srinivasan, commenting on the quicker pace of today’s data-driven intelligent systems.Tata Communications’ data insights are driven by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), and Srinivasan says these data analytics tools will be indispensable for enterprises looking to scale up their operations. “Because that will ensure the analytics is useful for the company to scale, by actually using algorithms that are smarter, that are faster, and can do the work consistently and self-learn – that’s where the scalability of the data will come from.”“I call those technologies the new members or new employees of every team. Because they need to be embraced, they need to be accepted, they need to be trained as you would do with any new employee,” he said.Tata Communications Next-generation tech advancements like cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT) enabled connectivity, and AI are being increasingly embraced by organizations as they pivot towards digitalizing their systems and processes. While accelerating the company’s digital maturity, they will also consume much more data to function efficiently.Providers of high-performance connectivity capabilities are looking towards 5G to provide the performance robustness to The technology, he said, is an enabler of What digital-led trends did Tata see forming at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic? “When COVID-19 started impacting places like India, workplaces obviously were seen as less safe from a proximity standpoint, so people started working from home,” noted digital chief Srinivasan.“That countered the [previous] data requirements of enterprises; we saw 650-plus [enterprise] customer orders for additional bandwidth augmentation” to cope with the additional demand during the pandemic.Meanwhile, and identified “I don’t know if it was a coincidence, but in the last three months, we have seen a lot more With the coronavirus still a threat in India, Srinivasan was hesitant to speculate about post-COVID digital transformation trends – but feels that a more rapid uptake of digitalization is inevitable for those enterprises that want to remain relevant.“Post-COVID is anyone’s guess, it’s crystal-gazing until things actually settle down, but from where I see things, I think digitalization is going to accelerate,” he said emphatically.“We’re going to see a massive acceleration of digital transformation – meaning more data, more connectivity, more security, because security is going to become ingrained in everything that we do.”",Is becoming a connected enterprise still possible in a post-COVID reality?,https://techwireasia.com/2020/07/pursuing-the-connected-enterprise-in-times-of-crisis-according-to-tata-communications/,30 July 2020

Rankings weigh up a number of factors to determine nationwide readiness including International Connectivity, Broadband Quality, Data Center Risk, Cybersecurity, Privacy, Government Regulatory Environment, among more, and a sustainable practices criteria called Power Grid, Green Policy, and Sustainability.In the 2020, Hong Kong has reemerged as the most cloud-ready state in APAC, reclaiming the top spot from Singapore. Hong Kong received a total score of 81.9 out of 100, while Singapore dropped to second in APAC with a total score of 81.5.Interestingly, both Hong Kong and Singapore rank higher than the UK (which would achieve a 79.7 score using the same criteria) and the US, which at 76.4 would rank behind third-placed New Zealand in APAC.New Zealand scored an overall 77.1, maintaining its third position from the previous Cloud Readiness Index, but its neighbor Australia dropped slightly in overall score to seventh in APAC. Rounding out the top five in the region is Taiwan and South Korea with total scores of 75.2 and 72.7, respectively.Taiwan takes the spot of Japan, the previous fourth overall in APAC but dropping to sixth in 2020. Japan rated only 1.7 out of 10 in the first criteria, International Connectivity, the second-lowest out of the 14 countries polled after eleventh-ranked Philippines (an abysmal 1.2 in International Connectivity, 55.3 overall).International Connectivity tracks how much bandwidth capacities have grown in each nation between 2018 and 2020.

One of the main ones will surely be the rapid shift towards working from home practices for many organizations – often for the first time ever. And it may well stick around.Even before COVID-19 wreaked its havoc, Gallup’s Not far off two-thirds of businesses worldwide currently have flexible workplace policies of some kind, according to the In this new era, CIOs and HR professionals have been buzzing about “gamifying” remote working operations as a means to keep the workforce engaged and to drive productivity, even when not in a shared working space. In fact, most businesses probably employ the method to a degree already, even if they don’t realize it.But is gamifying work the answer to keeping remote working staff engaged? With the higher adoption of For instance, When remote teams are more Without the physical identity of a workplace, a company can use gamification to teach new employees about the company, products, processes, culture, and ethos. Newly-employed team members could take a virtual tour of the company; quizzes could be sent about members of the team or different areas of the business.Going further, instead of team days or after-work drinks, culture can be developed and adapted for the new way of working with gamified teamwork or contests, such as ‘leagues’ and fantasy sports.Elements like sales charts and performance targets can be gamified with elements like rewards points, leaderboards, and a hierarchy of levels that the worker can ‘progress’ through. Positive outcomes for the individual and the team can be rewarded with appreciation badges and recognition within the entire company infrastructure.For all benefits that gamifying remote work processes can deliver, there could be drawbacks as well. Also, some organizations might also implement social collaboration and extra-curricular activities within the same platform, hoping to keep users engaged socially as well as performance-wise. This could prove damaging in the long run, blurring the lines between work and home life– a line that is already gray, given that remotely-relocated staff might be working from their homes.Regardless, gamification adds a bit of luster to otherwise potentially dull performance reports and analysis charts and offers an alluring way to maintain staff engagement while they’re remotely working.

Perhaps it should come as little surprise then that industrious startups around the region are constantly looking at ways to complement age-old farming practices with modern agritech, that can boost crop yields while reducing risks and inefficiencies for farmers.Agritech (agriculture technology) solutions have sprouted up across the continent to try and coax sustainable growth, but there is not one definitive system or methodology that can be applied to easily automate farm work, as planting and harvesting crops are subject to a variety of factors including rain fall, environmental factors, planting criteria, available machinery, and so forth.In addition, the growing issue of food security is also drawing attention to the last of sustainable agricultural practices in the region. FAO’s There have been a number of Some, like Others, like international robotics firm FJ Dynamics, had focused on artificial intelligence (AI), advanced smart manufacturing applications, and developing new energy capacities. The company which has R&D facilities in China, the Netherlands and Sweden is now supplementing its existing skills with data, digital modelling, and automation toolkits that can have a transformative impact on farming practices in Asia.Most of FJ Dynamics’ agritech solutions are anchored by data. The firm taps Microsoft Azure to retrieve and store vast swaths of precision data, and this is integrated with the Microsoft Azure Intelligent Cloud Platform to provide an IoT platform where autonomous vehicles affixed with sensors can collect and analyze data.Furthermore, FJ Dynamics has a range of fully autonomous agritech vehicles including automated tractors, harvesters, and rice transplanters that not only transmit IoT data, but can have their harvest route mapped out digitally. This 3D model can be used to control the rice transplanter for instance, not in the route it takes, but also the dispersal of fertilizer and measuring soil nutrient levels using its sensors and onboard equipment.“Once you set up a 3D model of the farm, you don’t need to modify it until you do some modification or construction work that alters the plot,” These smart vehicles also harness the advantages of data to schedule the daily, weekly, and seasonal tasks necessary to keep a working farm operating. An example would be using past planting season’s data to inform this year’s planting schedule, right down to spraying the exact amount of pesticides and herbicides required – reducing time and wastage on chemicals and other resources.Farmers in China claim that FJ’s smart robots have helped to improve efficiency by 10%. “Since these autonomous agriculture robots can work for 24 hours, it helps reduce the time I spent laboring out in the harsh conditions of the field,” one farmer commented.IoT-enabled agritech is really proving to be important towards accomplishing sustainable farming goals, as can be seen in this Elsewhere, a Malaysian industrial drone maker is providing ",How agritech driven by data is modernizing farming in Asia,https://techwireasia.com/2020/08/how-agritech-driven-by-data-is-modernizing-farming-in-asia/,11 August 2020

This is specially pertinent in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictions it has put on limiting the number of humans gathered at particular locations.If the trial proceeds as expected, FamilyMart expects to roll out robotic store assistants in as many as 20 of its Tokyo outlets, out of 16,600 locations across Japan by 2022, Robots being tapped to automate processesOver time, the system’s The robotics maker also says that programmed retail machines could cost up to ten times more than its hardware alone, and take months to complete.At present, the human controllers can be situated anywhere and can be operated by most people. Telexistence chief executive Jin Tomioka explained that his company’s technology lets people sense and experience places other than where they are, a concept dubbed “telexistence” by the startup’s co-founder, University of Tokyo professor Susumu Tachi, around forty years ago.“There are about 1.6 million people in Japan, who for various reasons are not active in the workforce,” said Tomohiro Kano, FamilyMart’s general manager in charge of franchise development. In the future, robots either operated by humans or using AI trained on human behavior, could become more prevalent in retail and other industrialized sectors.This would be a boon in countries like rapidly-aging Japan, as well as for operations that have been forced to operate with a lesser number of people due to emergency restrictions, such as with the coronavirus outbreak.Telexistence chief Tomioka says that his firm has been contacted by hotels, restaurants and even gas and oil companies since the emergence of COVID-19 in Japan.Professor Takeo Kanade, an AI and robotics scientist at Carnegie Mellon University who joined Telexistence as an adviser in February, believes that upcoming telexistence robots could also be used in hospitals so doctors could perform operations from remote locations– but that it might take another two decades before before robots can work in people’s homes.“In order for robots to be really usable at home we really have to be able to communicate,” he said. “The fundamental thing that is lacking is knowing how humans behave.”Last month,",Japan’s FamilyMart hedges bets on in-store robots,https://techwireasia.com/2020/07/japans-familymart-hedges-bets-on-in-store-robots/,22 July 2020

Cybercriminals were lightning fast to emerge and capitalize on the crisis and confusion.Cybersecurity is a complex beast. Despite the inch-thick, Teflon-coated plate we place around the IT network, it only takes one hasty click of a rogue phishing link to open a backdoor for cybercriminals to take control.While malware may become more sophisticated and the methods of attackers harder to detect, at present we are playing against a familiar if unrelenting foe; the age of quantum computing will bring a force of adversity of new proportions.“You might think that 2020 has been a rough year for cybersecurity, but we’re only just scratching the surface of what could go wrong,” Dr Ali El Kaafarani, founder of “Add quantum computers into the mix, and the entire foundation of today’s information security will be under threat.”Hard to fathom though it is today, few disagree that quantum computing will be a revolutionary technology.Heading towards a market worth of US$5.8 billion by 2025, every few months we hear of “Quantum computing is the future industry and infrastructure disruptor for organizations looking to use large amounts of data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to accelerate real-time business intelligence and innovate product development,” according to Heather Wells, the IDC’s senior research analyst of Infrastructure Systems, Platforms, and Technology.Theoretical use cases of the technology span anything concerning large, uncertain systems that need to be simulated, from predicting the financial markets to producing better, cheaper drugs.But as the quantum dawn approaches, conventions challenged include our notions of how we can protect our machines and networks — which, as we know, are regularly proven to be far from airtight. Of particular concern is quantum computing’s potential to eventually break encryption methods, which are used in varying degrees to safeguard data from individual to state level.“The scale of the quantum threat cannot be underestimated,” said Kaafarani. They will have the ability to smash through traditional public-key encryption, threatening the security of all sensitive information, past and present.“Data across cars, planes, medical devices, servers, and countless other devices cannot be secured retrospectively; they must be protected now.”The threat is too severe to ignore, but it’s not being overlooked. In fact, the US National Security AgencyThat process is now in theThe quantum computing cybersecurity threat comes down to the ease of which the technology will likely be able to break through existing methods of encryption. Existing types of encryption revolve around mathematical problems, such as integer factorization and discrete logarithm, which are difficult for classic machines to solve because of their computational limitations. But once quantum computers arrive, they will be able to easily solve those mathematical problems and thus break the most common form of modern encryption — public-key cryptography.“Our team is designing new post-quantum cryptographic solutions for software, hardware, and communications, which go way beyond those encryption methods, using different mathematical fields and principles that offer the complexity necessary to stump even a quantum computer,” said Kaafarani.He added confidence that there are no algorithms that can solve the type of mathematical problems that PQShield is using to build the next generation of public-key cryptography.Quantum computing advances have been incremental to date, but Kaafarani believes there have been notable advances in the last few years that have raise alarm bells for those looking at the application of the technology “as a weapon”.In late 2019, we started to see back and forth between Google and IBM about achieving ‘quantum supremacy’ when it came to performing certain calculations and then we saw the“At this current pace of innovation, it’s not unfeasible that we could see a nation-state or well-capitalized company develop a rudimentary quantum computer within the next decade. We might not know about it, it would be a huge competitive advantage and they might choose to keep it secret,” Kaafarani said.“While different industries have different timelines depending on how long their product life cycles are, it’s fair to say that for data across cars, planes, military vehicles, power stations, satellites, IoT – anything that will last over 10 years — this threat needs to be considered right now.”While with current computers, we lack the practical means to do so due to computational and memory limitations to do so, a malicious actor using a quantum computer could gain access to the secret key corresponding to any public key.An attacker could use that access to forge the signature of a software update and push an update to, say, an engine part and it will not know it’s forged, Kaafarani explained: “This would then enable the bad actor to alter the operations of an aircraft through that part as they wish in secret. That’s also what makes the famous ‘harvest now decrypt later’ attack possible.”It is then vital to act now to ensure a smooth yet secure transition into the powerful quantum era.",The quantum computing cybersecurity threat ‘cannot be underestimated’,https://techwireasia.com/2020/09/the-quantum-computing-cybersecurity-threat-cannot-be-underestimated/,3 September 2020

In fact, the continent accounts for six out of the top 10 most congested cities in the latest year ranking by Dutch location tech specialists In the Indian capital of Delhi, drivers in the sprawling metropolis spend as much as 58% more time stuck in traffic compared to drivers in any other city in the world. With the problem only getting worse, city officials have been determined to find a workable solution. That quest led them to a new intelligent traffic management system driven by Intelligent traffic management systems refer to the usage of AI, machine learning, computer vision, sensors, and data analysis tools to collect and analyze traffic data, generate solutions, and apply them to the traffic infrastructure.In Delhi, over 7,500 CCTV cameras, automated traffic lights, and one thousand LED signs carry sensors and cameras that are compiling real-time data on traffic conditions, which the AI processes into Alibaba’s City Brain is perhaps one of the most widely-distributed intelligent traffic management systems in Asia. The AI-powered system is already in deployment in 23 cities in China, as well as in other countries such as Malaysia. Gathering data such as video from intersection cameras and GPS data on the location of cars and buses, the platform crunches information in real-time and coordinates more than 1,000 road signals around the city with the aim of preventing or easing gridlock.In Hangzhou, Alibaba’s base, the thriving metropolis of 7 million people was once ranked fifth among China’s most congested cities but has now dropped to 57th on the list.Speaking to CNN, the company says that after two years of testing, the system appears to have shortened commutes and also helped first respondents by enabling fire trucks and ambulances to halve the amount of time it takes to respond to emergencies.“The cities in China are probably facing more challenges than any other city,” said Wang Jian, chairman of Alibaba’s technology steering committee, who said the technology could pave the way for other smart city applications.Municipalities with smart city aspirations are increasingly turning to AI-driven traffic solutions like this. Saudi Arabia, for instance, has a stated aim to transform into a smart nation as part of its Vision 2030 initiative. One of its major industrial hubs, Yanbu Industrial City, began integrating the AI-powered intelligent traffic management systems from Huawei, which now comprises over 250 high-definition cameras working at 16 major road intersections, supplying high-quality images and videos that feed data for officials to take immediate or planned actions.The Intelligent Traffic Management System (ITMS) pushes AI to the fore, running smart algorithms to automatically identify traffic violations including running red lights, crossing lanes, reverse driving, and lane marking infractions, among others. The response is much faster, running about 100,000 data records and capable of receiving a response within seconds.In addition to improving traffic conditions, ITMS also contributes towards Traffic management systems help to manage traffic and avoid accidents on the road, but they will also enable the traffic-choked cities in Asia to be more prepared to adopt autonomous vehicles which have a significantly less environmental footprint.What’s more, the power of AI that propels a lot of the data analysis of these systems, is also what powers the navigation systems of ride-hailing as well as last-mile delivery operators. Deliveries or order fulfillments that had to be delayed in the past, can now be enhanced significantly as cities around Asia continue taking up such intelligent traffic systems.",AI-powered traffic management is slashing Asia’s congestion problem,https://techwireasia.com/2020/08/ai-powered-traffic-management-is-slashing-asias-congestion-problem/,28 August 2020

SMIC also works with US firms including Qualcomm, Broadcom, and Texas Instruments, among others.The United States trade clash has so far put a shadow over Huawei’s survival and has pushed ByteDance towards a forced sale of the US arm of social media app TikTok.Beijing has announced it is “firmly opposed” to any such action against SMIC and has accused Washington of fabricating national security concerns to break international trade rules.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian accused the US of “blatant bullying” and urged it to stop “over-stretching the concept of national security to oppress foreign companies.”SMIC operates five chip-making plants in China, and can reportedly create nearly half a million wafers a month. But analysts believe that a US trade ban could threaten its existence, and stall China’s own ambitious technological growth.“If implemented, this will severely undermine SMIC’s ability to advance technologies,” Bernstein analysts said. “As US equipment is indispensable for advanced semiconductor R&D and production, such a restriction, once implemented, effectively allows the US government to decide how fast, or slow, SMIC’s technology progress would be.”With the US accounting for as much as Huawei has been ",The US could ban China’s biggest chipmaker next,https://techwireasia.com/2020/09/the-us-could-ban-chinas-biggest-chipmaker-next/,8 September 2020

That marks a significant departure from a production process that has served as a competitive differentiator for around 50 years, and comes as the firm begins to lose its grip on the In the conference call that saw Intel’s share price dip by 18% Friday, Swan told analysts that Intel would be prepared to “use somebody else’s process technology” as part of “contingency plans”.“That gives us much more optionality and flexibility. So in the event there is a process slip, we can try something rather than make it all ourselves,” he said.The statement followed confirmation of delays to production processes, that will see the roll-out of its 7-nanometer chip technology backed up by a year, probably more. Intel’s current best technology – 10-nanometer – was supposed to appear in 2017, but is only just creaking its way into wide scale production now.If production of 7-nanometer chips is delayed by 1 – 2 years, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) and Samsung would already be fabricating 5-nanometer chops, with higher density and lower energy use.However, since Swan’s words, Taiwan’s TSMC focuses on production alone, and its factories now outperform Intel’s, allowing more direct rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) to catch up with Intel on performance.And while TSMC is already providing the likely choice, Intel will be competing with TSMC’s own customers for attention, includingIntel’s announcement – pretty simply, that it’s struggling to produce chips, and the technology it’s working with is already obsolete compared to Asian market rivals – calls into question the United States’ efforts to bring critical manufacturing back to the country, including successful lobbying by US semiconductor technology companies themselves to secure subsidies for chip production on home soil.Two days before Swan’s announcement, the US House of Representatives passed an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act providing federal subsidies for semiconductor manufacturing.On the amendment, the Semiconductor Industry Association said: “Congress has a strategic opportunity to strengthen US semiconductor manufacturing and research, two crucial drivers of America’s economic strength, national security, and supply chain resilience. Today’s votes are important steps in the right direction and show there is broad, bipartisan support in Congress for bold semiconductor manufacturing incentives and research investments.”Days after Swan said Intel’s plants were not currently up to the task, Intel cut loose chief engineering officer Murthy Renduchintala, the executive in charge of its chip design and manufacturing operations. A statement read that changes were to “accelerate product leadership and improve focus and accountability in process technology execution.”Renduchintala was poached from Qualcomm in February 2016 and put in charge of design, engineering and manufacturing of Intel’s chips, under the firm’s Technology, Systems Architecture and Client Group. That arm will now be split up into multiple teams, all reporting directly to Swan.",Intel outsourcing – US chip stalwart looks to Asian firms for help,https://techwireasia.com/2020/07/intel-outsourcing-us-chip-stalwart-looks-to-asian-firms-for-help/,29 July 2020

Thanks to its technology hub in the northern state of Penang, the country’s economic recovery might just outpace its Southeast Asian neighbors.According to the state-funded non-profit investment promotion agencyThat foreign infusion accounted for nearly two-thirds of the country’s total, and InvestPenang pointed out that approved investments in the state were practically double the rate from the previous three months.The Penang’s tech cluster is one of the biggest electronics and electrical manufacturing and assembling hubs in the world, home to a major semiconductor equipment presence in the region. The state hosts factories owned by the likes of After years of mediocre subsistence, haplessly watching as China overtook global supply routes to become the dominant producer of electronic and electric components, Penang has now seen an incoming investment. In 2019, it hit a historic level, surpassing US$3 billion. The refreshed demand at the time was motivated by the developing Since then, entire industries have been devastated by the virus, and with China at the center of a With Chinese suppliers left out in the lurch, Pentamaster tried to source from other countries like Japan, South Korea, Germany, and Italy to fulfill its uptick in demand– only to find that certain parts were being routed from China, and that these supply chains were in disarray as well.“Even if you source from another country, the other country also depends on China,” said Pentamaster executive chairman Chuah Choon Bin. Pentamaster even tried altering the design of some of its components to accommodate parts from outside China. “We’re able to get supplies but the lead time is long – two to three months from Europe,” Chuah said, compared with the two to three weeks under normal circumstances.Pentamaster’s quandary is emblematic of the issues facing Penang’s semiconductor businesses. Despite the fact that Penang firms saw record sales last year from customers seeking to Analysts and the local industry spotlighted the April-June period as the biggest sales dip, anticipating that this was when existing stockpiles would run out. While many firms warned customers to expect delays, some have seen orders surge as buyers continue to seek suppliers outside of China.Now with pandemic measures easing and economies restarting, orders from non-Chinese suppliers are being renewed in earnest – and that is seeing Penang’s semiconductor trade reinvigorated, providing a healthy bump to the Malaysian economy as well. Joe Devanesan |Malaysia’s gross domestic product numbers is expected to show a contraction after the economy grew a mere 0.7% in Q1 2020, and unemployment has risen to 5.3% – the worst economic showing since 2009, and highest unemployment rate since 1990, respectively. Despite the grim forecast, the buoyancy of Penang’s tech hub hasOther analysts point to the sizable government stimulus package of nearly US$70 billion (equivalent to about 20% of Malaysia’s GDP) to help boost the local economy, but political uncertainty can be an unknown variable in the coming months.Nevertheless, Penang’s opposition-led state government hopes its tech sector can continue its upward trajectory and offer a path to navigate out of the pandemic’s effects. As Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow said last month, “There are still opportunities for Penang, particularly arising from global supply-chain reconfiguration and the emerging industries that will continue to play important roles in the post-COVID-19 era.” ",The tech haven that’s stimulating Malaysia’s pandemic recovery,https://techwireasia.com/2020/08/the-tech-haven-thats-stimulating-malaysias-pandemic-recovery/,13 August 2020
