The tendency to attribute human-like characteristics to software is exciting, if only a reflection of our cognitive biases. But beneath that initial fascination, AI has real substance in making use of the masses of data we are now accumulating. Simply, AI is machines executing tasks based on smart algorithms – it is computers learning from rich datasets and acting on them without being explicitly programmed to do so. As consumers, or just people, we encounter this technology frequently in the form of predictive modelling, or machine learning, where models are built for making future decisions based on new data points. That takes form in the products and services we use daily, whether it’s Netflix recommending what It’s the draw of smart products like these that have led to 93% of UK and US organizations considering AI to be a business priority according to a recent Vanson Bourne study commissioned byToo often, though, the power of AI and machine learning is enjoyed by the product user as UX benefits, and not necessarily by the product-makers, who may still be reliant on legacy solutions, among everyone else in the backend who have their own needs and requirements for the convenience that data-crunching algorithms can offer. Or for business-wide systems that could make enterprises more secure and resilient. AI has serious applications in optimizing the backend workings of the business, and enabling organizations to predict and respond to trends, events and even threats, faster. Splunk’s While an end-user product may be refined, the developers who made it may still be dealing with complex IT structures, thousands of alerts and an increasingly opaque environment. Now, there are software systems that can autonomously improve and replace IT operations. Artificial intelligence for IT operations, or As all businesses become tech-dependent and IT teams continue to grow, AIOps has become a burgeoning industry – with no shortage of vendors and specialists emerging – focused on performance monitoring, event correlation and analysis, IT service management and automation. The end result? Time and money saved for the business and more productive (and happier) engineers. “Automation continues to be the most important end-goal for IT operations teams who are swimming in data and routine tasks,” OpsRamp SVP, Bhanu Singh, previously told Gone are the days when businesses could ‘hide in the herd’; cybercriminal’s techniques are so far spread that just connecting to the internet opens the door to threats, including compromised websites, Unfortunately, businesses are unprepared to fully prevent, detect, and respond to the growing number and sophistication of threats.Consider that ransomware attacks occur every 14 seconds, according to a Cyber Security Ventures Official Annual Cybercrime Report. Given so many attacks, businesses are turning to AI and machine learning capabilities to help shore up a scarcity of cybersecurity experts.In cybersecurity, machine learning has applications in advanced threat detection and stopping insider threats, which require a more nuanced approach to monitoring and response. Sophisticated attacks that move laterally within a network, or breaches caused by unwitting access to sensitive information can be tackled by automated and intelligent anomaly detection. AI and machine learning can enable analysts and security teams to paw through masses of log and event data from applications, endpoints and network devices to conduct rapid investigations and uncover patterns to determine the root cause of incidents. As the threat landscape evolves, and the cost of a cybersecurity breach becomes increasingly catastrophic for small and large businesses alike, AI and machine learning is handing organizations improvements in detection speed, impact analysis and response. Data, and lots of it, is core to the success of any AI or machine learning initiative. To leverage the benefits of these intelligent systems within the organization, businesses must be prepared to conduct the manual effort and resource required to refine large volumes of data that give AI models the fuel they need to learn and burn.At IBM — a company with a better view than most of the emerging technologies market — data-related struggles are a top reason the company’s clients have ceased or cancelled AI projects, according to the firm’s SVP of Cloud and Cognitive Software, Arvind Krishna.Speaking at “[…] you run out of patience along the way, because you spend your first year just collecting and cleansing the data,” said Krishna. Companies can become impatient and disillusioned with the work, he explained, and “kind of bail on it.”However, the more data you have, the better, and once the grunt work and heavy-lifting is out the way, effective AI and machine learning means organizations are no longer bogged down by data; they are elevated by it. The challenge is getting there, but the benefits speak (and work) for themselves. ",Just about UX?

This technology is proving incredibly powerful and is fast advancing and gaining momentum rapidly across various use cases and industries.By understanding, analyzing, and extracting meaningful data from images faster and more accurately than humans, computer vision’s use cases span often controversial use in anything from facial recognition systems to identifying hairline flaws in manufacturing and identifying anomalies from MRI scans.Computer vision is also fundamental to the development of cutting-edge robotics, including autonomous vehicles and drones, that can ‘see’ and act on their surroundings. In short, the technology is enabling technologists to push new boundaries across a massive expanse of sectors, such as defense, manufacturing, retail, insurance, and retail.Here are some of the more interesting use cases of computer vision currently at play:Use of computer vision with CCTV systems may be unnerving and, in some cases, plain controversial. A number of tech giants, including IBM, have publicly backed away from offering its technology to law enforcement, But computer vision used in surveillance systems isn’t just about spying on citizens or holding criminals to account. Construction sites can employ the technology to identify when workers or vehicles are straying into dangerous, off-limit zones, sounding an alert to the individual on the ground, or even sending a signal that shuts off machinery.Computer vision also has the ability to ensure safety at large and crowded public events, such as identifying a risk of overcrowding, and triggering digital displays with prompts to move back, or signposting to areas of more space.At the Roland Garros tennis tournament in Paris this year, mobile operator Orange piloted use of real-time analysis of CCTV images using CV to enable staff to guide visitors to their seats, reducing the risks of overcrowding and improving the sports fans’ visitor experience.In these types of scenarios, edge computing enables both near real-time response, but also privacy, with images being processed locally on a private network on site.Downtime is a sin in manufacturing, and that puts the sector on a constant quest to employ technologies that speed up time-to-market while ensuring quality is optimized. Computer vision can remove and far out-perform the role of humans from the process of quality control, adding accuracy and repeatability to what is otherwise a monotonous task.Every successful manufacturer will have a rigorous quality control process in place but in certain highly-regulated industries, such as Aviation, Space, and Defense Industry, the stakes of a flaw in a product can risk not just reputation but could pose a serious threat to human lives. 3D-enabled computer vision systems can identify the smallest defect in a component that the human eye might miss.Even in the pharmaceutical industry, computer vision is being used to detect and analyze bacterial growth in Petri dishes containing samples of vaccines in production. This is proving a more accurate and effective alternative human inspection in detecting production problems and ultimately can bring medicines and vaccines into circulation faster.Optical character recognition (OCR) is another subset of computer vision that can identify characters from handwritten, typed, or printed text and turn it into machine-readable text. This can transform data-entry tasks where masses of data in disparate formats is collected and must be decoded constantly.OCR has replaced the need, in many cases, for humans to scour through and manually index scanned paper documents.If an insurance company is receiving more than 20 million documents a day, for example — a large volume of which could be emergencies which would require urgent attention — OCR can identify data while Another application of OCR is in extracting valuable, forgotten information from banks of legacy data that organizations may have generated over decades. The found data can subsequently be used by artificial intelligence and machine learning systems to make predictions. It may also be used to paw through medical records in efforts to uncover recurring cases of illnesses for example.",Computer vision — three exciting ways it’s changing business,https://techwireasia.com/2020/08/computer-vision-three-exciting-ways-its-changing-business/,27 August 2020

It now needs to be online, available at any time, and it needs to be fast.Messengers are proving valuable channels to support customers in a way that is natural to them. The approach can enable customer service teams to deliver fast, friendly and personal support. But to cater for a higher volume of support requests, many businesses are turning to chatbots and automation technology.Well-designed chatbots are the key to scaling conversational support, but there’s a lot of debate around what makes a good chatbot. Many guides advise starting by designing a ‘persona’ for your bot — find a cute avatar that’s on brand, choose a name, maybe teach it some witty banter. This can be a big-time investment, and should actually be bottom of the list. The customer isn’t looking for a chatbot to be their friend. It’s much more important whether the bot can actually give them the information they need — and it should stay out of the way if it can’t.Great bots start with a set of principles. Good principles serve as an enduring foundation for decisions, allowing the focus to stay on the customer experience. Chatbots have shown huge promise for resolving support issues from the beginning: customers save time, and businesses save money — a clear win-win. But the sticky spot is designing bots that There are a few ways to avoid this. First, set expectations with customers. It’s a bad start when a bot says something as general as “Hi, what can I help you with today?”, as very few bots can help Instead, the bot should give hints as to what it If your platform supports it, the bot should quickly assess how likely it is that the user’s query can be resolved by an automated system. Bots are most helpful when it comes to common, simple queries that don’t require the bot to develop an understanding of complex issues. A good bot will proactively funnel complex, long-tail issues over to your human support team. If the bot can’t help, it should let the customer know early, and explicitly excuse itself. If customer support isn’t available, redirecting a customer to a help center is preferable to getting stuck going round-and-round with a bot that knows it can’t actually help you.Nothing leads to worse customer experience than someone feeling like they’re trapped in support jail. A well-designed bot will let customers exit at any time, even if there isn’t a human to talk to. Don’t be tempted to keep customers in the bot flow because you don’t have enough human support resources. Trapping the customer without a place to go, or building a navigation flow without a clear exit, is not good for the customer experience. Bad experiences lead to frustration, negative word-of-mouth, and an unwillingness to later engage with self-serve content that The best way to allow customers to exit the bot depends on context. The most obvious solution is to have an always-present button that lets the customer exit. But some less obvious features will work just as well. Consider designing your bot to say one thing and then stop unless spoken to again, or to bow out if a user ignores its prompts. This lets customers exit by default. You can also design your bot to recognize exit syntax — words like “exit” or “quit” or “go away” — that a customer may say. The end goal is to make it easy for a customer to leave the conversation if they need to — the responsibility lies with the business to facilitate this.Customer relationships are the cornerstone of business success, and you can’t build great customer relationships without great experiences and personal communication. The “personal” generally means communication that feels friendly, easy, and quick. From a technical standpoint, this means bots should have no artificial loading delays and no walls of text. Customers also shouldn’t have to hunt for answers through an endless tree or be encouraged to stay in a support interaction that can’t help them. If your bot has certain flows that some customers must follow to progress their request — for example, if the customer must answer questions about their company before talking to sales, or enter their product make and model before accessing technical support—these flows shouldn’t be triggered until they are needed. Don’t frontload them automatically to customers they aren’t relevant for. Similarly, if customers are sometimes required to grant privacy permissions, or authenticate, the bot should prompt for these only as needed.HOW CHATBOTS ARE MAKING BANKING MORE CONVERSATIONALThe impact of each individual delay is small, but taken together will add up to a support experience that feels either fast and respectful, or frustrating and uncaring. Customers will notice when this principle is followed: they’ve been jaded by waiting on hold while a voice tells them how much ‘their time is respected,’ so businesses that actually do follow this principle stand out.If you’re looking to design or use chatbots to improve your customer support, the best place to start is with customer-centric design principles. While technology is advancing rapidly, the foundations of good experiences will remain.This article was contributed by Fergal Reid (Ph.D.), Principal Machine Learning Engineer at ",How can we make chatbots that hit home with users?,https://techwireasia.com/2020/09/how-can-we-make-chatbots-that-hit-home-with-users/,1 September 2020

That is exactly what Malaysian budget carrier AirAsia announced last week that it will be adopting JIFFY.ai’s RPA platform that leverages artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP) to automate an organization’s tasks and processes, helping to create both time and efficiencies in the long run.“The implementation leverages JIFFY.ai’s AirAsia chief transformation officer Azli Mohamed was quoted as saying that the implementation of RPA followed a review of AirAsia’s internal processes and workflows, which showed that business or robotic process automation can be “At AirAsia, we continuously seek to push the boundaries of innovation. RPA will allow our workforce to automate mundane and repetitive tasks, which will free up valuable time to focus on other tasks that require thinking and experience-based judgment,” Mohammed said.AirAsia kicked off its present phase of digital transformation goals back in 2016, and the popular budget airline has been ramping up digital-first targets all across the company during the past few lean months, where local travel has only been reinstated for less than two months, and international flights are still grounded.

But it is data, and what banks can do with it, which holds the real potential, from personalized spending plans and rewards to unnoticeable tweaks to user experience that make interactions seamless and intuitive, tailored to the individual user at the right time. Banks are leveraging customer data to dramatically enhance the customer experience and communications, once again making that personal touch and face-to-face advice possible, without stepping foot in-branch. This is conversational AI or chatbot technology, and it’s making our interactions with banks, from fintech challengers to incumbents, much more seamless. It’s enabling customers to ‘talk’ to banks about their accounts in a way that’s comfortable and intuitive, whenever they like. For banks themselves, it’s generating increased customer acquisition, conversions, and retention rates, all at a lower cost.AI is no new concept, of course, but its uptake in the banking industry has been accelerated by awareness of the need to enhance digital experiences and the availability ofLike any other business, banks are under pressure to move quickly with technology or lose out to more hungry and ambitious competitors and aggressive new kids on the block. With Gartner predicting that customers will manage 85% of their relationships with an enterprise without interacting with a human, and TechEmergence believing chatbots will become the primary consumer application within the next five years, conversational AI is now a series focus. And while digitization has been taking place in banking for decades, keeping pace with customers’ expectations for quick, convenient, secure services that can be accessed from anywhere on any device is no mean feat, especially as society barrels closer to a cashless future by the day. While established banks are shifting services online and investing heavily in front-end IT infrastructure, they are now vying for customers’ increasing expectations for “data-fueled, hyper-personalized experiences in real-time,” which incumbents in other sectors have been quicker to adapt to. Overall investment in new IT increased from 24% in 2016 to 33% in 2019, according to a report by Capgemini, but middle- and back-end operations are often still based on complex, manual business processes, leading to fragmented customer experiences.  The rise of conversational AI in banking has been fueled by a rise in conversational interfaces and natural language processing (NLP) technology that enables us to interact, transact, and collaborate using natural chat. Leveraging the behavior we are most used to using in social or mobile communications with our friends, family, and colleagues on channels like Whatsapp, Messenger, Teams or Slack, conversational AI programs break down the formality of communications with our banks, changing perceptions of them as a flexible, accessible, personable service built to serve us. It’s not just challenger banks like Monzo, Revolut, or Starling that are employing this conversational AI. Bank of America’sAs these communications channels continue to advance, customers can interact with banking processes, day and night, from enrolling new customers and walking through features, enabling the reporting potential fraud, applying for an increase on their credit card limit, or requesting a specific breakdown of spending on groceries, for example. The successful implementation of this technology has positive effects for the bank as a whole, which needs to invest less in customer service agents — while improving the attentivity of service among those remaining — with cost savings channeled into further innovation. The development in conversational AI would logically be further advances in the use of voice, negating the need for typing altogether. A customer’s app, in this sense, could become their own personal, financial advisor, able to answer any questions they have about their account or spending, drilling down into the data it has available. Mark Jones |As conversational AI or chatbot technology continues to advance, customers will see a shift away from mobile banking to conversational user interfaces (CUI). If they prefer, all interactions could be carried out by simply chatting (typing or speaking) to a CUI. Moving towards this conversational banking strategy will not be solely a technology endeavor — it will require the banking industry to continue to attract human talent with AI and NLP skills to keep pace with advancements of technology and ensure they’re integrated.

This is specially pertinent in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictions it has put on limiting the number of humans gathered at particular locations.If the trial proceeds as expected, FamilyMart expects to roll out robotic store assistants in as many as 20 of its Tokyo outlets, out of 16,600 locations across Japan by 2022, Robots being tapped to automate processesOver time, the system’s The robotics maker also says that programmed retail machines could cost up to ten times more than its hardware alone, and take months to complete.At present, the human controllers can be situated anywhere and can be operated by most people. Telexistence chief executive Jin Tomioka explained that his company’s technology lets people sense and experience places other than where they are, a concept dubbed “telexistence” by the startup’s co-founder, University of Tokyo professor Susumu Tachi, around forty years ago.“There are about 1.6 million people in Japan, who for various reasons are not active in the workforce,” said Tomohiro Kano, FamilyMart’s general manager in charge of franchise development.

Both popular retail chains’ web services were brutalized by users on The scathing reviews were unsettling for Australia’s most well-known store chain – in a bid to modernize, David Jones had been posting significant web sales increases over the past two years as the company turned towards a more digital shopping experience.“Whilst our stores remained open during the lockdown, our online store sales doubled. This sales growth, coupled with dispatch and delivery delays associated with the increased volumes, led to unprecedented demands on the customer services teams,” said Daniele Iezzi, the customer services general manager at David Jones and Country Road Group“We saw increases of up to 500% in customer contact. Call volumes increased so quickly that at one stage customers were telephoning us every two seconds. Needless to say, wait times for calls ballooned out to levels we weren’t comfortable with.”Gartner reportsFor David Jones Australia, the company has decided to support its growing online sales by moving its maligned customer service operations to run on Amazon Connect and Salesforce cloud-based systems, to better manage customer feedback and ensure customer fulfillment is taking priority.Customer services GM Iezzi told “This placed pressure on the customer services team. The increase in online sales drove a 50% growth in phone calls to the team with the main inquiry being related to order status,” explained Iezzi. “Coupled with outdated systems, this demand was creating an experience that didn’t live up to our customers’ expectations.”David Jones decided to retain its customer relationship services in-house rather than outsourcing them, allowing the company to have a more direct grasp of their customers’ expectations, and brought in Deloitte to build a new platform based on Amazon Connect and Salesforce’s Service Cloud.Salesforce has repeatedly been ranked as one of the top customer service and support software vendors, with David Jones Australia is also using Amazon Connect’s “If you’re ringing to check on the status of your order, Amazon Connect will locate the order in your Salesforce profile, confirm its details with you, and then [make] an API call to our order management system and to our delivery partners [to] relay the order status to you, without the need for human intervention,” he continued. “This is really powerful as order status inquiries are still the main source of customer contacts to our team.”For out-of-hours calls, the system will create an ‘unresolved case’ in Service Cloud, filling in the details and reason for the call automatically. Amazon Connect can also determine to transfer calls to an agent, by looking at the customer’s profile info in Salesforce, identifying the caller by their phone number.The digital customer care platform has provided David Jones some of the space to pivot to additional support channels, such as transitioning store staff who were not working much during the lockdown, and redeploying them to handle excess online queries.“One of the great features of Amazon Connect and Service Cloud is the flexibility to scale up quite easily,” noted GM Iezzi. “As a result, we could redeploy these team members quickly using their own devices, and we could call on team members from any state to work with us remotely. They were able to hit the ground running.”In addition, David Jones Australia also increased its live chat and chatbot capacities, including using chatbots to better understand customer intent early and to obtain necessary customer information “such as their name, a case number or product information, helped reduce our handling time, and increase agent productivity in chat.”Iezzi says the capabilities of Amazon Connect and Salesforce allowed the retailer to keep “every channel of communication open” despite customer care agents undergoing the transition to work-from-home during Australia’s lockdown period.Buoyed by the recent customer response improvements, David Jones plans to identify opportunities “to automate further customer intents so that we can deflect more calls away from the customer services team.”“As we continue to leverage the power of Amazon Connect used in conjunction with Service Cloud, we will continue to gather information and insights about our customers, as each contact creates a case in the customer’s profile in Salesforce,” said Iezzi.David Jones is also planning to provide better tools to supplement the customer’s in-store experiences as well. “We’re looking to implement chat and messaging in-store,” Iezzi confirmed. “This will give customers more options in how they’d like to engage with our store teams, and allow sales assistants to view their customer’s shopping history, allowing them to sell the right product more easily and more efficiently.

Both popular retail chains’ web services were brutalized by users on The scathing reviews were unsettling for Australia’s most well-known store chain – in a bid to modernize, David Jones had been posting significant web sales increases over the past two years as the company turned towards a more digital shopping experience.“Whilst our stores remained open during the lockdown, our online store sales doubled. This sales growth, coupled with dispatch and delivery delays associated with the increased volumes, led to unprecedented demands on the customer services teams,” said Daniele Iezzi, the customer services general manager at David Jones and Country Road Group“We saw increases of up to 500% in customer contact. Call volumes increased so quickly that at one stage customers were telephoning us every two seconds. Needless to say, wait times for calls ballooned out to levels we weren’t comfortable with.”Gartner reportsFor David Jones Australia, the company has decided to support its growing online sales by moving its maligned customer service operations to run on Amazon Connect and Salesforce cloud-based systems, to better manage customer feedback and ensure customer fulfillment is taking priority.Customer services GM Iezzi told “This placed pressure on the customer services team. The increase in online sales drove a 50% growth in phone calls to the team with the main inquiry being related to order status,” explained Iezzi. “Coupled with outdated systems, this demand was creating an experience that didn’t live up to our customers’ expectations.”David Jones decided to retain its customer relationship services in-house rather than outsourcing them, allowing the company to have a more direct grasp of their customers’ expectations, and brought in Deloitte to build a new platform based on Amazon Connect and Salesforce’s Service Cloud.Salesforce has repeatedly been ranked as one of the top customer service and support software vendors, with David Jones Australia is also using Amazon Connect’s “If you’re ringing to check on the status of your order, Amazon Connect will locate the order in your Salesforce profile, confirm its details with you, and then [make] an API call to our order management system and to our delivery partners [to] relay the order status to you, without the need for human intervention,” he continued. “This is really powerful as order status inquiries are still the main source of customer contacts to our team.”For out-of-hours calls, the system will create an ‘unresolved case’ in Service Cloud, filling in the details and reason for the call automatically. Amazon Connect can also determine to transfer calls to an agent, by looking at the customer’s profile info in Salesforce, identifying the caller by their phone number.The digital customer care platform has provided David Jones some of the space to pivot to additional support channels, such as transitioning store staff who were not working much during the lockdown, and redeploying them to handle excess online queries.“One of the great features of Amazon Connect and Service Cloud is the flexibility to scale up quite easily,” noted GM Iezzi. “As a result, we could redeploy these team members quickly using their own devices, and we could call on team members from any state to work with us remotely. They were able to hit the ground running.”In addition, David Jones Australia also increased its live chat and chatbot capacities, including using chatbots to better understand customer intent early and to obtain necessary customer information “such as their name, a case number or product information, helped reduce our handling time, and increase agent productivity in chat.”Iezzi says the capabilities of Amazon Connect and Salesforce allowed the retailer to keep “every channel of communication open” despite customer care agents undergoing the transition to work-from-home during Australia’s lockdown period.Buoyed by the recent customer response improvements, David Jones plans to identify opportunities “to automate further customer intents so that we can deflect more calls away from the customer services team.”“As we continue to leverage the power of Amazon Connect used in conjunction with Service Cloud, we will continue to gather information and insights about our customers, as each contact creates a case in the customer’s profile in Salesforce,” said Iezzi.David Jones is also planning to provide better tools to supplement the customer’s in-store experiences as well. “We’re looking to implement chat and messaging in-store,” Iezzi confirmed. “This will give customers more options in how they’d like to engage with our store teams, and allow sales assistants to view their customer’s shopping history, allowing them to sell the right product more easily and more efficiently. Naturally, this will be integrated with Service Cloud.”",Why Aussie department store David Jones went cloudwards for CX,https://techwireasia.com/2020/07/why-aussie-department-store-david-jones-went-cloudwards-for-cx/,23 July 2020

This is specially pertinent in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictions it has put on limiting the number of humans gathered at particular locations.If the trial proceeds as expected, FamilyMart expects to roll out robotic store assistants in as many as 20 of its Tokyo outlets, out of 16,600 locations across Japan by 2022, Robots being tapped to automate processesOver time, the system’s The robotics maker also says that programmed retail machines could cost up to ten times more than its hardware alone, and take months to complete.At present, the human controllers can be situated anywhere and can be operated by most people. Telexistence chief executive Jin Tomioka explained that his company’s technology lets people sense and experience places other than where they are, a concept dubbed “telexistence” by the startup’s co-founder, University of Tokyo professor Susumu Tachi, around forty years ago.“There are about 1.6 million people in Japan, who for various reasons are not active in the workforce,” said Tomohiro Kano, FamilyMart’s general manager in charge of franchise development. In the future, robots either operated by humans or using AI trained on human behavior, could become more prevalent in retail and other industrialized sectors.This would be a boon in countries like rapidly-aging Japan, as well as for operations that have been forced to operate with a lesser number of people due to emergency restrictions, such as with the coronavirus outbreak.Telexistence chief Tomioka says that his firm has been contacted by hotels, restaurants and even gas and oil companies since the emergence of COVID-19 in Japan.Professor Takeo Kanade, an AI and robotics scientist at Carnegie Mellon University who joined Telexistence as an adviser in February, believes that upcoming telexistence robots could also be used in hospitals so doctors could perform operations from remote locations– but that it might take another two decades before before robots can work in people’s homes.“In order for robots to be really usable at home we really have to be able to communicate,” he said. “The fundamental thing that is lacking is knowing how humans behave.”Last month,",Japan’s FamilyMart hedges bets on in-store robots,https://techwireasia.com/2020/07/japans-familymart-hedges-bets-on-in-store-robots/,22 July 2020

It now needs to be online, available at any time, and it needs to be fast.Messengers are proving valuable channels to support customers in a way that is natural to them. The approach can enable customer service teams to deliver fast, friendly and personal support. But to cater for a higher volume of support requests, many businesses are turning to chatbots and automation technology.Well-designed chatbots are the key to scaling conversational support, but there’s a lot of debate around what makes a good chatbot. Many guides advise starting by designing a ‘persona’ for your bot — find a cute avatar that’s on brand, choose a name, maybe teach it some witty banter. This can be a big-time investment, and should actually be bottom of the list. The customer isn’t looking for a chatbot to be their friend. It’s much more important whether the bot can actually give them the information they need — and it should stay out of the way if it can’t.Great bots start with a set of principles. Good principles serve as an enduring foundation for decisions, allowing the focus to stay on the customer experience. Chatbots have shown huge promise for resolving support issues from the beginning: customers save time, and businesses save money — a clear win-win. But the sticky spot is designing bots that There are a few ways to avoid this. First, set expectations with customers. It’s a bad start when a bot says something as general as “Hi, what can I help you with today?”, as very few bots can help Instead, the bot should give hints as to what it If your platform supports it, the bot should quickly assess how likely it is that the user’s query can be resolved by an automated system. Bots are most helpful when it comes to common, simple queries that don’t require the bot to develop an understanding of complex issues. A good bot will proactively funnel complex, long-tail issues over to your human support team. If the bot can’t help, it should let the customer know early, and explicitly excuse itself. If customer support isn’t available, redirecting a customer to a help center is preferable to getting stuck going round-and-round with a bot that knows it can’t actually help you.Nothing leads to worse customer experience than someone feeling like they’re trapped in support jail. A well-designed bot will let customers exit at any time, even if there isn’t a human to talk to. Don’t be tempted to keep customers in the bot flow because you don’t have enough human support resources. Trapping the customer without a place to go, or building a navigation flow without a clear exit, is not good for the customer experience. Bad experiences lead to frustration, negative word-of-mouth, and an unwillingness to later engage with self-serve content that The best way to allow customers to exit the bot depends on context. The most obvious solution is to have an always-present button that lets the customer exit. But some less obvious features will work just as well. Consider designing your bot to say one thing and then stop unless spoken to again, or to bow out if a user ignores its prompts. This lets customers exit by default. You can also design your bot to recognize exit syntax — words like “exit” or “quit” or “go away” — that a customer may say. The end goal is to make it easy for a customer to leave the conversation if they need to — the responsibility lies with the business to facilitate this.Customer relationships are the cornerstone of business success, and you can’t build great customer relationships without great experiences and personal communication. The “personal” generally means communication that feels friendly, easy, and quick. From a technical standpoint, this means bots should have no artificial loading delays and no walls of text. Customers also shouldn’t have to hunt for answers through an endless tree or be encouraged to stay in a support interaction that can’t help them. If your bot has certain flows that some customers must follow to progress their request — for example, if the customer must answer questions about their company before talking to sales, or enter their product make and model before accessing technical support—these flows shouldn’t be triggered until they are needed. Don’t frontload them automatically to customers they aren’t relevant for. Similarly, if customers are sometimes required to grant privacy permissions, or authenticate, the bot should prompt for these only as needed.HOW CHATBOTS ARE MAKING BANKING MORE CONVERSATIONALThe impact of each individual delay is small, but taken together will add up to a support experience that feels either fast and respectful, or frustrating and uncaring. Customers will notice when this principle is followed: they’ve been jaded by waiting on hold while a voice tells them how much ‘their time is respected,’ so businesses that actually do follow this principle stand out.If you’re looking to design or use chatbots to improve your customer support, the best place to start is with customer-centric design principles. While technology is advancing rapidly, the foundations of good experiences will remain.This article was contributed by Fergal Reid (Ph.D.), Principal Machine Learning Engineer at ",How can we make chatbots that hit home with users?,https://techwireasia.com/2020/09/how-can-we-make-chatbots-that-hit-home-with-users/,1 September 2020

But it is data, and what banks can do with it, which holds the real potential, from personalized spending plans and rewards to unnoticeable tweaks to user experience that make interactions seamless and intuitive, tailored to the individual user at the right time. Banks are leveraging customer data to dramatically enhance the customer experience and communications, once again making that personal touch and face-to-face advice possible, without stepping foot in-branch. This is conversational AI or chatbot technology, and it’s making our interactions with banks, from fintech challengers to incumbents, much more seamless. It’s enabling customers to ‘talk’ to banks about their accounts in a way that’s comfortable and intuitive, whenever they like. For banks themselves, it’s generating increased customer acquisition, conversions, and retention rates, all at a lower cost.AI is no new concept, of course, but its uptake in the banking industry has been accelerated by awareness of the need to enhance digital experiences and the availability ofLike any other business, banks are under pressure to move quickly with technology or lose out to more hungry and ambitious competitors and aggressive new kids on the block. With Gartner predicting that customers will manage 85% of their relationships with an enterprise without interacting with a human, and TechEmergence believing chatbots will become the primary consumer application within the next five years, conversational AI is now a series focus. And while digitization has been taking place in banking for decades, keeping pace with customers’ expectations for quick, convenient, secure services that can be accessed from anywhere on any device is no mean feat, especially as society barrels closer to a cashless future by the day. While established banks are shifting services online and investing heavily in front-end IT infrastructure, they are now vying for customers’ increasing expectations for “data-fueled, hyper-personalized experiences in real-time,” which incumbents in other sectors have been quicker to adapt to. Overall investment in new IT increased from 24% in 2016 to 33% in 2019, according to a report by Capgemini, but middle- and back-end operations are often still based on complex, manual business processes, leading to fragmented customer experiences.  The rise of conversational AI in banking has been fueled by a rise in conversational interfaces and natural language processing (NLP) technology that enables us to interact, transact, and collaborate using natural chat. Leveraging the behavior we are most used to using in social or mobile communications with our friends, family, and colleagues on channels like Whatsapp, Messenger, Teams or Slack, conversational AI programs break down the formality of communications with our banks, changing perceptions of them as a flexible, accessible, personable service built to serve us. It’s not just challenger banks like Monzo, Revolut, or Starling that are employing this conversational AI. Bank of America’sAs these communications channels continue to advance, customers can interact with banking processes, day and night, from enrolling new customers and walking through features, enabling the reporting potential fraud, applying for an increase on their credit card limit, or requesting a specific breakdown of spending on groceries, for example. The successful implementation of this technology has positive effects for the bank as a whole, which needs to invest less in customer service agents — while improving the attentivity of service among those remaining — with cost savings channeled into further innovation. The development in conversational AI would logically be further advances in the use of voice, negating the need for typing altogether. A customer’s app, in this sense, could become their own personal, financial advisor, able to answer any questions they have about their account or spending, drilling down into the data it has available. Mark Jones |As conversational AI or chatbot technology continues to advance, customers will see a shift away from mobile banking to conversational user interfaces (CUI). If they prefer, all interactions could be carried out by simply chatting (typing or speaking) to a CUI. Moving towards this conversational banking strategy will not be solely a technology endeavor — it will require the banking industry to continue to attract human talent with AI and NLP skills to keep pace with advancements of technology and ensure they’re integrated.

The tendency to attribute human-like characteristics to software is exciting, if only a reflection of our cognitive biases. But beneath that initial fascination, AI has real substance in making use of the masses of data we are now accumulating. Simply, AI is machines executing tasks based on smart algorithms – it is computers learning from rich datasets and acting on them without being explicitly programmed to do so. As consumers, or just people, we encounter this technology frequently in the form of predictive modelling, or machine learning, where models are built for making future decisions based on new data points. That takes form in the products and services we use daily, whether it’s Netflix recommending what It’s the draw of smart products like these that have led to 93% of UK and US organizations considering AI to be a business priority according to a recent Vanson Bourne study commissioned byToo often, though, the power of AI and machine learning is enjoyed by the product user as UX benefits, and not necessarily by the product-makers, who may still be reliant on legacy solutions, among everyone else in the backend who have their own needs and requirements for the convenience that data-crunching algorithms can offer. Or for business-wide systems that could make enterprises more secure and resilient. AI has serious applications in optimizing the backend workings of the business, and enabling organizations to predict and respond to trends, events and even threats, faster. Splunk’s While an end-user product may be refined, the developers who made it may still be dealing with complex IT structures, thousands of alerts and an increasingly opaque environment. Now, there are software systems that can autonomously improve and replace IT operations. Artificial intelligence for IT operations, or As all businesses become tech-dependent and IT teams continue to grow, AIOps has become a burgeoning industry – with no shortage of vendors and specialists emerging – focused on performance monitoring, event correlation and analysis, IT service management and automation. The end result? Time and money saved for the business and more productive (and happier) engineers. “Automation continues to be the most important end-goal for IT operations teams who are swimming in data and routine tasks,” OpsRamp SVP, Bhanu Singh, previously told Gone are the days when businesses could ‘hide in the herd’; cybercriminal’s techniques are so far spread that just connecting to the internet opens the door to threats, including compromised websites, Unfortunately, businesses are unprepared to fully prevent, detect, and respond to the growing number and sophistication of threats.Consider that ransomware attacks occur every 14 seconds, according to a Cyber Security Ventures Official Annual Cybercrime Report. Given so many attacks, businesses are turning to AI and machine learning capabilities to help shore up a scarcity of cybersecurity experts.In cybersecurity, machine learning has applications in advanced threat detection and stopping insider threats, which require a more nuanced approach to monitoring and response. Sophisticated attacks that move laterally within a network, or breaches caused by unwitting access to sensitive information can be tackled by automated and intelligent anomaly detection. AI and machine learning can enable analysts and security teams to paw through masses of log and event data from applications, endpoints and network devices to conduct rapid investigations and uncover patterns to determine the root cause of incidents. As the threat landscape evolves, and the cost of a cybersecurity breach becomes increasingly catastrophic for small and large businesses alike, AI and machine learning is handing organizations improvements in detection speed, impact analysis and response. Data, and lots of it, is core to the success of any AI or machine learning initiative. To leverage the benefits of these intelligent systems within the organization, businesses must be prepared to conduct the manual effort and resource required to refine large volumes of data that give AI models the fuel they need to learn and burn.At IBM — a company with a better view than most of the emerging technologies market — data-related struggles are a top reason the company’s clients have ceased or cancelled AI projects, according to the firm’s SVP of Cloud and Cognitive Software, Arvind Krishna.Speaking at “[…] you run out of patience along the way, because you spend your first year just collecting and cleansing the data,” said Krishna. Companies can become impatient and disillusioned with the work, he explained, and “kind of bail on it.”However, the more data you have, the better, and once the grunt work and heavy-lifting is out the way, effective AI and machine learning means organizations are no longer bogged down by data; they are elevated by it. The challenge is getting there, but the benefits speak (and work) for themselves. ",Just about UX?

That is exactly what Malaysian budget carrier AirAsia announced last week that it will be adopting JIFFY.ai’s RPA platform that leverages artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP) to automate an organization’s tasks and processes, helping to create both time and efficiencies in the long run.“The implementation leverages JIFFY.ai’s AirAsia chief transformation officer Azli Mohamed was quoted as saying that the implementation of RPA followed a review of AirAsia’s internal processes and workflows, which showed that business or robotic process automation can be “At AirAsia, we continuously seek to push the boundaries of innovation. RPA will allow our workforce to automate mundane and repetitive tasks, which will free up valuable time to focus on other tasks that require thinking and experience-based judgment,” Mohammed said.AirAsia kicked off its present phase of digital transformation goals back in 2016, and the popular budget airline has been ramping up digital-first targets all across the company during the past few lean months, where local travel has only been reinstated for less than two months, and international flights are still grounded. Carriers in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region are expected to lose up to US$113 billion in revenue this year, data from the No doubt looking to “With the contactless kiosks, guests making their essential travel can print their boarding pass and baggage tag after checking-in online on airasia.com or through the mobile app, ensuring a full These include enhanced features on the AirAsia mobile app and contactless kiosks with The AirAsia statement also pointed out that robotic process automation was being adopted by the AirAsia Group in stages, as the automation process befits the internal functionality and requirements of the individual departments.“RPA will enable us to increase productivity, reduce errors, and redeploy resources to higher-value functions. All these benefits will ultimately translate into sizable cost savings and top-line revenue growth,” Azli said.AirAsia’s commission of the Kerala-based RPA startup was a major coup for JIFFY.ai, who also released a “We are delighted to have been chosen as the partner for AirAsia to help them on their digital transformation journey,” commented Babu Vinod Sivadasan, the co-founder and CEO of JIFFY.ai. “The JIFFY.ai automate platform is expandable and extensible and will give them the intelligent automation power they need to streamline and improve complex business processes while supporting innovation to help the business grow.”",AirAsia redirects its business priorities using robotic process automation,https://techwireasia.com/2020/08/airasia-redirects-its-business-priorities-using-robotic-process-automation/,18 August 2020
Automation,"Computer vision is enabling systems to understand visual components — or, in a more poetic sense, it’s giving machines eyesight.The technology is an innovative branch of machine learning, enabling com",https://cdn.techwireasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1355496497-1-897x500.jpg,"Computer vision is enabling systems to understand visual components — or, in a more poetic sense, it’s giving machines eyesight.The technology is an innovative branch of machine learning, enabling computers to identify and classify objects using image or video recognition. This technology is proving incredibly powerful and is fast advancing and gaining momentum rapidly across various use cases and industries.By understanding, analyzing, and extracting meaningful data from images faster and more accurately than humans, computer vision’s use cases span often controversial use in anything from facial recognition systems to identifying hairline flaws in manufacturing and identifying anomalies from MRI scans.Computer vision is also fundamental to the development of cutting-edge robotics, including autonomous vehicles and drones, that can ‘see’ and act on their surroundings. In short, the technology is enabling technologists to push new boundaries across a massive expanse of sectors, such as defense, manufacturing, retail, insurance, and retail.Here are some of the more interesting use cases of computer vision currently at play:Use of computer vision with CCTV systems may be unnerving and, in some cases, plain controversial. A number of tech giants, including IBM, have publicly backed away from offering its technology to law enforcement, But computer vision used in surveillance systems isn’t just about spying on citizens or holding criminals to account. Construction sites can employ the technology to identify when workers or vehicles are straying into dangerous, off-limit zones, sounding an alert to the individual on the ground, or even sending a signal that shuts off machinery.Computer vision also has the ability to ensure safety at large and crowded public events, such as identifying a risk of overcrowding, and triggering digital displays with prompts to move back, or signposting to areas of more space.At the Roland Garros tennis tournament in Paris this year, mobile operator Orange piloted use of real-time analysis of CCTV images using CV to enable staff to guide visitors to their seats, reducing the risks of overcrowding and improving the sports fans’ visitor experience.In these types of scenarios, edge computing enables both near real-time response, but also privacy, with images being processed locally on a private network on site.Downtime is a sin in manufacturing, and that puts the sector on a constant quest to employ technologies that speed up time-to-market while ensuring quality is optimized. Computer vision can remove and far out-perform the role of humans from the process of quality control, adding accuracy and repeatability to what is otherwise a monotonous task.Every successful manufacturer will have a rigorous quality control process in place but in certain highly-regulated industries, such as Aviation, Space, and Defense Industry, the stakes of a flaw in a product can risk not just reputation but could pose a serious threat to human lives. 3D-enabled computer vision systems can identify the smallest defect in a component that the human eye might miss.Even in the pharmaceutical industry, computer vision is being used to detect and analyze bacterial growth in Petri dishes containing samples of vaccines in production. This is proving a more accurate and effective alternative human inspection in detecting production problems and ultimately can bring medicines and vaccines into circulation faster.Optical character recognition (OCR) is another subset of computer vision that can identify characters from handwritten, typed, or printed text and turn it into machine-readable text. This can transform data-entry tasks where masses of data in disparate formats is collected and must be decoded constantly.OCR has replaced the need, in many cases, for humans to scour through and manually index scanned paper documents.If an insurance company is receiving more than 20 million documents a day, for example — a large volume of which could be emergencies which would require urgent attention — OCR can identify data while Another application of OCR is in extracting valuable, forgotten information from banks of legacy data that organizations may have generated over decades. The found data can subsequently be used by artificial intelligence and machine learning systems to make predictions. It may also be used to paw through medical records in efforts to uncover recurring cases of illnesses for example.",Computer vision — three exciting ways it’s changing business,https://techwireasia.com/2020/08/computer-vision-three-exciting-ways-its-changing-business/,27 August 2020
