Singapore Ranked Number One in Asia in Latest Global Innovation Index			,Article has not blurp," Singapore has retained its overall top ranking as Asia’s most innovative nation in the latest Global Innovation Index (GII) released by the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), Cornell University & INSEAD. It has held this position since 2014.The GII ranks world economies according to their innovation capabilities. Consisting of roughly 80 indicators, grouped into innovation inputs and outputs, the GII aims to capture the multi-dimensional facets of innovation.Singapore continued to top the Innovation Input Sub-Index which gauges elements of the national economy which embody innovative activities. and maintained its 15th position in the Innovation Output Sub-Index which captures actual evidence of innovation results.Singapore continued to perform well, ranked 1st globally,  in the traditionally strong indicators of ‘Political and operational stability’, ‘Government effectiveness’, ‘Tertiary education’ and ‘High tech manufacturing’.Ranked 2nd globally in ‘Government’s online service’, ‘Regulatory environment’, ‘Investment’ and ‘knowledge intensive’ employment, the continued good performance in these indicators are a nod to the country’s efforts to build a strong and active IP regime. Singapore also improved on the ‘Mobile app creation’ indicator, moving up three places to 7th globally.“Besides being fully digital for all our IP application services since 2014, IPOS has enhanced our mobile app for trademark applications, the first of its kind in the world, conducted fully virtual IP dispute hearings, converted our face-to-face trainings to online modules and increased the frequency of complimentary online IP business and legal clinics.”“IPOS is continuously innovating to give enterprises a business edge during the pandemic where time is of the essence. We are also encouraged to see significant movement in the indicator measuring the proportion of female employees with advanced degrees as well as our credible showing in the inaugural ‘Global brand value’ indicator” said Mrs Lee.Singapore also ranked number 1, from 36th last year, for the ‘Knowledge Workers – females employed with advanced degrees’ indicator for the first time. This indicator measures the proportion of female employees with advanced degrees, out of the total employed.A new indicator ‘Global brand value’ was added to the GII for the first time. It better recognises the commercial importance of brands in the marketplace. This indicator looks at the total value of a country’s brands in Brand Finance’s top 5,000 global brand database, as a proportion of GDP. Singapore was ranked 13th.Globally,

"DOT, DTI empowers Philippine MSMEs through online platforms and webinars			",Article has not blurp,"The goal of the Philippine Harvest e-commerce site of the Department Of Tourism is a contactless farm-to-market experience that promotes local farmers and micro, small and medium enterprises. In this new normal, Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo-Puyat urges the public that it is best to utilise the advancements there is today using the internet by visiting phharvestdot.com.The Philippines is rich in agricultural lands thus the abundant harvests. However, without a proper systematized way of the distribution of the goods, most of them go to waste. In a survey, over 2,000 tons of food are thrown away every single day just in Metro Manila, even though one in three Filipinos lives below the poverty line. This is indeed a global problem not only happening in the country.To prevent food waste, the creation of the said portal was even pushed to materialize. This is a sustainable solution that even the Department of Trade and Industry also believes in as they successfully launched a platform that does just that called “Go Lokal!”.Powered and supported by an IT solutions company, the portal guarantees an easy online shopping and an elevated dining experience in every household as it promises fast and reliable delivery from merchants that deliver the food fresh and clean right onto doorsteps.The platform gives a unique privilege to all partner-merchants. They will gain proper access to business tools available and respective accounts for order tracking, inventory management, product catalogues and links to their social media sites, etc.The aim of “Go Lokal” is to also empower Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises in the country that sells not only fresh produce but other locally manufactured goods. Interested buyers need to visit the site https://www.shopinas.com/go-lokal and are assured a convenient, practical and virus transmission-free transactions.In a recent study, the country’s economy had shrunk due to weaker remittances, prolonged, stringent domestic lockdown and soft foreign demand. Experts see the GDP falling 6.1% this year, which is down 2.2 percentage points from last months forecast. Next year, it is projected to accelerate by 7.5%.The sudden drop of the economy in the Philippines pushes government agencies like DTI and DOT to provide opportunities to MSMEs through substantial webinars and the creation of effective online platforms. The buy local, go local concept revolves around the message for citizens to give preference to the products of Philippine MSMEs at this time of pandemic to contribute to the improvement of the economy.The Senate and House Of Representatives, under the Bayanihan Bill 2, recognises the tourism sector as key in their efforts of ensuring the survival of the 99.9% of 144,640 MSMEs with businesses ranging from accommodation to food services based on the 2018 data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). In a recent statement by DOT, they expressed their gratitude to the Bicameral Conference Committee for approving an allocation of PHP 10 billion (US$ 206 million) for the tourism industry under the Bayanihan To Recover As One or the Bayanihan Bill 2.Meanwhile, the Department of Trade and Industry organised free webinars for MSMEs. In Laguna, they conducted a web-based training on Retail Management in the local “Negosyo” (Business) Centre. The interaction was also aired via Facebook Live to address a wider audience. The free webinar is part of the SME Roving Academy which promotes the continuance of learning among MSMEs to become competitive in domestic and international markets amid the health crisis.",https://opengovasia.com/dot-dti-empowers-philippine-msmes-through-online-platforms-and-webinars/,http://opengovasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4_Sept_2020_2-Ph-Revised-Version.jpg
Intelligent Automation can revolutionise the workings of public sector organisations			,Article has not blurp,"The pandemic has taught the world a lesson – a global crisis can hit anytime and it is critical to be prepared for it.One sector that is most severely impacted by large-scale crises – like the current pandemic – is the public services sector. Rather than scaling down, public services (especially some departments) work more than usual to ensure all basic amenities are available to the citizens as they were instructed to stay at homes.In times like these, where certain public sector departments were working incessantly to help citizens, automation can augment the government’s ability to serve people.In light of its relevance in these times, OpenGov Asia hosted OpenGovLive! Virtual Breakfast Insight with delegates from various public sector agencies from Singapore to discuss and encourage the adoption of automation technologies.The unattended virtual worker is the future of automationThe session opened with a presentation from Mohit Sagar, Group Managing Director and Editor-in-Chief, OpenGov Asia.Mohit began by highlighting the fact that COVID-19 dismantled the status quo in governments and organisations.With all the world going into sudden lockdown, governments had to take the responsibility to provide better and seamless services for citizens and businesses to survive.This was where Digital transformation and implementation of Robotic Process Automation helped ease the pressure in government departments/agencies that were over-burdened.Robotic Process Automation (RPA) not only helps lighten the load by taking over complex repetitive tasks but also helps cut costs – a constant challenge for governments as they continue their battle against COVID-19.Mohit also gave the attendees a glimpse into what the future would look like for automation technology. He opined that the unattended virtual worker who runs on a pre-decided schedule will become the norm.From a long-term perspective, unsupervised robots tend to become more efficient, with lower costs for deploying new ones, scaling up or maintenance. This is mainly due to the higher-utilisation rate of robots and the convenience of adopting the same technology to a different use case in different organisation. The centralisation aspect during execution also ensures that risk aspects around confidentiality and data are managed better.Mohit concluded his presentation by advising organisations to collaborate with experts as they embark upon their journey towards automation rather than trying to do everything on their own.RPA has moved from the realm of mundane to the realm of innovationAfter Mohit’s presentation, Dan Ternes, Chief Technology Officer, Blue Prism, shared his insights on the topic.Dan began by clarifying that RPA today has moved way forward from how we understood it traditionally to a more exciting and comprehensive phase. The way businesses and organisations are using RPA today is in the realm of innovation and no longer merely to do repetitive tasks. Dan explained that traditionally RPA is thought of as something that would boost operational excellence, but now it has away from the spectrum of the menial and the mundane.Organisations are now focusing on automating tasks that are complex, strategic and mission-critical to them. He shared how the public health sector in Singapore used a Blue Prism solution to manage complex data on public health during the pandemic.This journey is now going into the second wave of RPA implementation which involves using it in conjunction with other technologies like Optical Character Recognition, chatbox, natural language processing, etc.He called this the wave of digital simplification. He revealed that a national taxation agency is successfully implementing this in combination with other complementary technologies for automatic compliance checks on deductions.After this, he felt, comes a third wave that breaks away from the constraints of the past. This wave includes initiatives like smart nation and smart cities. He was quick to point out that it is also important to make sure that the new, the digital and the sophisticated must continue to tie into the legacy applications that run our society. Otherwise, the whole system could become get very disintegrated.Dan concluded by sharing that Blue Prism has had a great record of adding value in all three waves and encouraged the delegates to lean towards automation.Various use cases of automation in the field of EducationAfter an enlightening introduction by Dan, Peter Buckmaster, Director of Digital Experience Design at The NSW Department of Education shared his knowledge with the delegates.Peter began by introducing the NSW Department of Education which is the largest education department in the southern hemisphere and shared how it is using automation in its functioning.  He explained that they are using a combination of RPA and AI to enhance their work efficiency and accuracy.The first major bit of automation initiated by the department was automating the process of employee onboarding/access management and the digitising of paperwork involved in the process. This resulted in saving almost 460 hours of work that was done by the department workforce.He listed the 6 broad uses of AI and RPA in the field of education.Peter also played the audience a video featuring examples of how the above-mentioned use cases come into play. The video greatly helped delegates visualise how incorporating automation can enable work efficiency without requiring more time.After Peter’s presentation, it was time to go into a time of polling and engage in discussions around the topic.On the first question about how automation fits into your organisation’s digital transformation journey, almost half the room voted for: Improve work efficiency (53%).Some really interesting perspectives came out of the discussion on this question. A Chief Medical Informatics Officer from a major hospital in Singapore reflected that he chose the above option because, in large organisations like his own, a lot of processes are still undertaken manually by staff. This leads to monotony and impedes workflow efficiency. By automating these processes, high-value work can be allocated to the employees.On the next question regarding the biggest challenge in implementing your digital strategy, the audience was split between Inflexible business processes and teams (37%) and Lack of properly skilled teams (37%).A senior governance officer from an educational institution shared that she chose the former because they feel the need to automate or update some of their existing technology, but always get a lot of resistance from the employees. So there is a need to change people’s mindsets and make them more accepting of technology.On the final question about the biggest area of priority for incorporating automation, the audience was divided between Citizen Engagement (26%) and Co-agency collaboration (26%).On this one, a Chief Digital Officer from another health care institution in Singapore reflected that they are looking to first begin with automating the more manual tasks and then gradually diversify into other more complex and specific tasks.After this fruitful discussion, Mohit invited Dan to bring the session to a conclusion with closing remarks.Dan thanked all the delegates and speakers for participating and contributing to the session. He re-emphasised the fact that automation has great potential and can help solve some of the problems of the “new normal”. He also felt that, apart from having the right technology, it is equally important to have the right vision and implementation process to achieve the desired goals.The delegates left the virtual insight well informed and empowered.",https://opengovasia.com/various-use-cases-of-automation-in-the-field-of-education/,http://opengovasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Group-pic-Sept.-3rd.jpg
WA government and Austmine launch digital mining export hub			,Article has not blurp,"The Western Australian Mines and Petroleum Minister officially launched the inaugural Austmine WA METS Digital Mining Export Hub in Port Hedland on 4 September 2020. The Hub putting Western Australia’s Mining Equipment, Technology and Services sector in the spotlight.The The virtual hub aims to initially provide services in Port Hedland, Karratha, Newman, Kalgoorlie and Bunbury. METS businesses are a vital part of the resource sector supply chain and contributed an estimated $27 billion to the WA economy in 2018-19.The WA Government has committed $350,000 and in-kind support worth $50,000, through Invest and Trade WA, to establish this initiative.  The Mines and Petroleum Minister stated that the launch of Austmine’s WA METS Digital Mining Export Hub is ground-breaking for the local METS sector and a fantastic result for Western Australia.He noted that Western Australia’s mining technology is world-leading, and the hub will enable these local companies to provide their services across the globe. The export hub will not only be vital in supporting the State’s recovery, post-COVID-19 but will also be a boost to jobs and in the state’s local economies.The Pilbara MLA stated that the establishment of the Hub was an exciting announcement for mining, equipment, technology and services companies in the Pilbara region. There’s no better time than now to identify new export opportunities for the sector, and use Western Australia’s digital capability to strengthen our economy.WA is the world’s top mining destinationAccording to The Australian state, which is home to almost 130 export-oriented mining projects and hundreds of smaller quarries and mines producing over 50 different commodities, had ranked second in 2018. In August 2020, the Premier of Western Australia and the Mines and Petroleum Minister The investment, which forms part of the WA Recovery Plan, will boost exploration opportunities and provide next-generation geoscience information for Western Australia’s resources sector. The EIS supports five high-level programs, including the successful co-funded drilling program, which offers up to a 50% refund for innovative drilling in under-explored areas in WA. The additional $5 million will increase funding for the EIS to $15 million in 2020-21, resulting in an extra $3 million which is available across the next two co-funded drilling rounds.The funding will accelerate the acquisition of airborne electromagnetic data from the southern half of the State, which is testing for the presence of critical battery minerals (such as nickel) and water. Curtin University, in Bentley, has a 27-year-old ion microprobe that previously provided valuable data about the timing of mineralising events, but it is no longer fully operational.State funding of $3.2 million will enable Curtin to secure $5 million in Commonwealth funding to purchase a new CAMECA-1300 Ion Microprobe, which will be an Australian first. In addition to its geoscience applications, the instrument will be used to support the Australian Space Agency’s interest in increasing Australian participation in international deep space sample return missions.The Premier noted that the flow-on effect from this additional investment in exploration and technology will result in drilling companies deploying more rigs and workers, and lead to new resource discoveries.”The Mines and Petroleum Minister had said that the new ion microprobe instrument is next-generation, it will be an Australian-first and one of only five in the world. It will revolutionise their understanding of how and when Western Australia’s key mineral deposits formed.The resources industry is already a world-leader in technology and research; having access to the Ion Microprobe will provide the State with a unique technological advantage to discover the next generation of resources. Interestingly, the Ion Microprobe has potential applications well beyond the resources sector, such as understanding the formation of our solar system.",https://opengovasia.com/wa-govt-and-austmine-launch-digital-mining-export-hub/,http://opengovasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Article_4-Sept-2020_3-Aus.jpg
Dark matter experiments planned for 2021			,Article has not blurp,"Australian scientists hope to start experiments to detect dark matter as early as next year, following the successful excavation of the site for the underground laboratory at the Stawell Gold Mines.ANSTO While the search for dark matter is a core mission for SUPL, ANSTO’s main contribution relates to the extremely low background radiation environment needed to operate the SABRE Dark Matter detector.ANSTO operates highly sensitive radiation detectors at its Lucas Heights campus, which are used for high precision measurements of very low levels of radiation from natural materials.It is expected that the sensitivity of such measurements can be increased by a factor of 10 or more thanks to the ultra-low background levels which will be achieved in SUPL because it is located one kilometre underground, a Member of the Steering Project Committee said.ANSTO health researchers are also interested in using SUPL to investigate the development of biological systems, such as cell cultures in the absence of background radiation.The scientists are very much looking forward to the commissioning of SUPL, which will be the first underground physics laboratory in the Southern Hemisphere, and to the exciting discoveries, it will enable.The Stawell Underground Physics Laboratory (SUPL) will have a main research hall that is 33 metres long, 10 metres wide and 12.3 metres high, and a side access wing configured in an L shape – to house the multi-disciplinary work of scientists from five research partners, including the University of Melbourne.With all excavation and rock removal undertaken at a depth of approximately one kilometre underground, the physics lab can be now built within the caverns.Funding for the lab was announced in 2019 with Commonwealth and Victorian governments both allocating $5 million each for the facility. The Australian Research Council awarded a $35 million Centre of Excellence for Dark Matter Particle Physics, with headquarters at the University of Melbourne.The Centre’s activities will establish the Stawell Underground Physics Laboratory as the Southern Hemisphere’s epicentre for dark matter experiments.While the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has recently prevented visits underground, the early works package of the project has been completed, ensuring the site is now ready for the lab to be constructed.The General Manager of the mines stated that the excavations for the laboratory are now completed, with the mining teams creating two laboratory chambers, 1025m underground.The main laboratory chamber excavation was a technical piece of work, undertaken in stages, as it is significantly larger than our normal operations and requires a higher level of engineering to ensure the longevity of the facility.It’s an exciting period in the development of the laboratory as it moves into the construction phase and the eventual realisation of a world-class scientific facility.Explosives and heavy machinery were used to excavate the two caverns, clearing approximately 4700 cubic metres before rock bolts and supports were installed before spraying shotcrete to reinforce the cavern.The materials used to secure the cavern and cover the rock walls were all sourced from special suppliers to ensure the environment is suitable to host the types of experiments, which will be located within the laboratory.The next step will be to award a contract to build the underground lab, with the tender process expected later this year and the Stage 1B works to be undertaken in 2021.It is expected that in about one year from now, the scientists will be able to fit out a high-tech laboratory. As cosmic rays cannot reach one kilometre underground, the team is in an ideal location to carry out experiments.According to ",https://opengovasia.com/dark-matter-experiments-planned-for-2021/,http://opengovasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Article_4-Sept-2020_1-Aus.jpg

This is a huge number, which impacts not only the police who are responsible for finding them, but also the many people who are affected and devastated by the uncertainty and helplessness of having loved ones missing,” she said.The 2020 hackathon will be scaled to maximise the chances of finding crucial pieces of data. Each registered participant will be provided with free self-paced foundational training modules for OSINT, specifically developed for the Australian OSINT environment.During October, a webinar series will be delivered by AustCyber featuring OSINT and cybersecurity experts from Australia and the USA. The live-stream on 29 October will provide enhanced user experience for the day, including presentations, mentoring sessions and a live leader board. A new website will also be deployed to provide information to participants and serve as an ongoing resource for the broader community.Many major organisations, firms and banks have returned as sponsors for 2020, with OSINT Combine joining as a new sponsor. The founder and CEO of OSINT Combine said that OSINT is derived from publicly available information or open-source information.Using public resources and people in a group setting for a ‘collection activity’ allows the analysts and investigators to spend more time on the critical part of connecting the dots and understanding the picture,” he said.The concept of this crowdsourced platform originates from the not-for-profit organisation which has provided its CTF model throughout Canada and the United States, with monthly virtual events known as ‘Global OSINT Search Party CTFs’ that allow participation from around the world.The organisation operates in many locations around the world, working with multiple law enforcement agencies.

Philippine government services going fully digital by 2022			,Article has not blurp,"The Full Digital Transformation Act of 2020 mandates all government agencies, government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs), instrumentalities and Local Government Units (LGUs) to adopt a digital plan that aligns with the Philippine Digital Transformation Strategy 2022 as proposed by Senator Sherwin Gatchalian.The bill of full digitalisation of government services promotes a zero-contact policy and facilitates ease of procedures. All of this is meant to streamline government services in accordance with Republic Act No. 11032 or the Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act of 2018, Republic Act No. 11234,  the Energy Virtual One-Stop Shop Act and other applicable laws.Digitalisation is no longer just another trend, but it the way the world is heading to. This the rationale Senator Gatchilian emphasised in the proposal. Full digitalisation is the Philippine vision two years from now. This transformation will be achieved through business and wireless networks, resulting in higher efficiency and lower costs.The lawmaker spoke about the e-Gov Master Pan and the related e-Gov and Integrated Government Philippines (iGovPhil) programmess that have been launched by the Department of Science and Technology’s (DOST’s) Information and Communication Technology Office. However, he believed that the Philippines has been slow in integrating digital technology to improve the delivery of services and experience a sense of modernisation in the country.With COVID-19, digital transformation in the government has taken on a sense of urgency. Contract tracing and distribution of aid could be smoother if data is harmonised and digital systems are put in place more comprehensively. The proposed bill plans to harmonise collected personal data of Philippine citizens, businesses, land and transactions, among others. Further, it will open opportunities that will likely drive the government to invest in developing additional organisational capability and staff competencies.With all these plans taking on urgency in the light of the pandemic, the government predicts it will be expedient to build a Digital Transformation Department to manage the ambitious and yet highly practical investment. The department would be expected to support and roll out the office’s digital transformation strategy.With a future-ready mindset, The DTD is projected to shoulder responsibilities to promote and guide the onboarding and training of government personnel using e-Gov services.Another plan is that the DTD monitor and adopt networking tools to boost the communication channels and feedback mechanism to the general public. To help the public monitor the status of their requests at any given time, the DTD will provide a system that allows and promotes coordination among various departments to ensure that workflows, responsibilities, and accountabilities are properly for tracking purposes.He felt that it is the duty of government officials to encourage people to rise above dire situations. This is why this the best time for government authorities in the country to invest in technology to serve its citizens in a timely manner. Senator Gatchalian stressed that there is no reason to delay the drive to realise the full modernisation of government services to serve Philippine citizens – adequately, efficiently and securely.",https://opengovasia.com/philippine-government-services-going-fully-digital-by-2022/,http://opengovasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Article_3_Sept_2020_4-Ph.jpeg

UoW to develop AI to aid women’s safety on public transport			,Article has not blurp,"Researchers from the SMART Infrastructure Facility at the University of Wollongong (UOW) are developing software that will allow existing closed-circuit television cameras to automatically identify and report suspicious or violent incidents.The While many factors contribute to this, transportation was identified as an area where improvement could be made. A team led by Dr Johan Barthelemy will develop artificial intelligence (AI) software that will automatically analyse real-time camera feeds and alert an operator when it detects a suspicious incident or an unsafe environment. The AI will be trained to detect incidents such as people fighting, a group of agitated persons, people following someone else, and arguments or other abnormal behaviour. It can also identify an unsafe environment, such as where there is a lack of lighting.The system will then alert a human operator who can quickly react if there is an issue. The data and reports automatically generated by the software can then be used to help prevent the abuse and violence committed towards women after dark in public transportation. Helping him on the project will be a PhD student whose thesis looks at using computer vision across multiple cameras to understand traffic and pedestrian flow. The team is using open-source code that tries to estimate the poses of a human being and predict if there’s a fight.The incident will then be reviewed by a human controller who will accept or reject the suggestion made by artificial intelligence. In this way, the program will become smarter, learning in a similar way to a human being. As far as the team knows, nothing like this has been attempted globally. The researchers are pushing the limits of technology.The SMART Infrastructure Facility One of the largest research institutions in the world dedicated to helping governments and businesses better plan for the future, Since opening, SMART has built an international profile working with government agencies in Australia and around the world and has developed a strong network of global collaborators.

Vietnam launches AI platform			,Article has not blurp,"The The launch is part of a chain of events to introduce Made-in-Vietnam digital platforms to serve the national digital transformation program for 2025, with a vision to 2030 approved by Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc. According to the MIC Deputy, Nguyen Thanh Hung, the fourth industrial revolution is fundamentally changing production around the world on the back of breakthroughs in the internet and AI.Many countries have recognised the inevitable development and significant transformational impact of AI in all aspects of life, which changes the balance of economic, military, and political power, he said, adding that AI is the heart of digital transformation.The Viettel AI Open Platform provides platform technologies using AI to help automate, optimise and efficiently operate organisations and businesses via the world’s most advanced techniques. The platform is currently focusing on areas such as Vietnamese speech processing technology (Speech Processing), Vietnamese natural language processing technology (Natural Language Processing), and computer vision technology (Computer Vision).The Director of the Viettel Cyberspace Centre, Nguyen Manh Quy, noted that to strengthen research cooperation to boost the national digital transformation program, Viettel is providing the platform free of charge to individuals, businesses and organisations that registered to use it during its application development phase.In recent years, e-government platforms have developed rapidly. The number of provincial-level built-in and data sharing platforms has increased dramatically. In the past six months, the proportion of ministries and provinces that have this kind of platform increased by over three times; in February 2020, only 25 ministries, provinces had platforms, equivalent to 27%. The figure was 76 ministries July, or 82.6%. Currently, the rate of level-4 online public services is about 15.9%, doubling that of the same period last year. E-document exchanges between state agencies have reached a rate of about 88.5%, very close to the target of 90% by 2020.Vietnamese enterprises have gradually mastered core technologies and developed technology platforms for digital transformation.

IoT and AI can help improve responsiveness to current and future Critical Events			,Article has not blurp,"In coping with the current crisis, the need for accurate and actionable information is paramount for an effective response – but there has never before been a scenario like the current COVID-19 pandemic. In case of a critical event, whether it is an active shooter, natural disaster or pandemic, access to information is vital.One crucial lesson that emergency responders have learned from simulations is that information is often too fragmented to provide actionable intelligence: the larger the incident, the more complicated it is to collect and assess information and coordinate a response.There are, however, many tools available to tame this complexity for more rapid and effective response and to minimise impact on responders. These generally address four stages of response management.In the first, they gather data from various sources to help assess the context and severity of a critical event, calling upon analytical tools to digest and correlate data to help response teams understand what is happening now and what could or will happen later. A second stage locates assets, employees or vital equipment. In a third stage, these systems offer emergency responders and organisations the tools to act by informing people of actions to take, mass-scale notifications for people in affected areas and tools for collaboration between response teams. The final stage enables responders and others concerned to review and evaluate the critical event so that future response can be improved.Incident response management platforms are often homegrown among responsible agencies and organisations, but technology providers exist to support efforts. Some of these technologies consolidate functionality for all four stages into a single system. As reportedIn smart buildings and smart cities, sensors can provide details about temperature, toxic gases and other hazardous conditions. Smart streetlights can analyse traffic congestion and plan evacuation routes through AI analytics. Body cameras can relay live intelligence from public safety workers to the Incident Command Center (ICS), while crisis teams can use IoT wearables to warn and guide civilians.Artificial intelligence technologyThe Chinese search engine Baidu has made its Linearfold algorithm available to researchers and medical teams to fight the outbreak to assist in the analysis of the virus, while across the world researchers are turning to AI technology to predict its spread.Even when everybody understands that it is vital to track data on people’s condition and location during the current times, but it has a definite The privacy issues are relevant to technology providers, which also see a growing trend among companies that want to know which employee is in which location. In the case of the COVID-19 outbreak, employers may want to see which employee has been in close proximity to a person who has tested positive for the virus.However, technology’s role in containing and mitigating the virus in the absence of a rapid and reliable diagnostic tool cannot be undermined. It lets governments respond and recover from the global pandemic which would have been a more herculean task than it already is.Technology providers who are seeking to improve response, stewardship of sensitive data and transparency of processes moving forward must understand that establishing trust and confidence amongst people is of paramount importance.",https://opengovasia.com/iot-and-ai-can-help-improve-responsiveness-to-current-and-future-critical-events/,http://opengovasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CEM-Image.jpg
AI and Advanced analytics can help champion next generation compliance in the financial sector industry			,Article has not blurp,"Continuing its series of sessions with the financial sector industry across ASEAN, OpenGov Asia hosted its third OpenGovLive! Virtual Breakfast Insight with delegates from Thailand on 20 August 2020.The event once again saw a 100% attendance and a great level of involvement from the audience on the topic of Understanding the importance of compliance and risk management for the financial industry in these tough times and the urgency of deploying tech in this process was the major focus of the varied insights from delegates and speakers.The session was opened by Mohit Sagar, Group Managing Director and Editor-in-Chief at OpenGov Asia.Mohit shed light on the harsh reality of the times where everybody is masking data. Further, the danger from threat actors is becoming more and more sophisticated.These cybercriminals are leveraging advanced technology with a destructive mindset and without any constraints of regulation or compliance.Financial organisations cannot afford to lag behind in keeping up with the latest technological developments in the field if they want to protect themselves and simultaneously outdo adversaries to survive.On the issue of compliance, Mohit felt that it had to be seen as a part of the big picture and not seen in isolation. Compliance must be part of a robust framework that necessitates using AI and Analytics to derive desired and clean outcomes.However, it is important to understand that technology can only augment existing human resources, not replace them.He concluded by stressing the need for focused leadership and the need to collaborate with partners who champion the field of technology.After Mohit, Nutapone Apiluktoyanunt, Managing Director, SAS Thailand shared his views on the topic with the audience.Nutapone began by introducing the company and given a brief overview of the work globally. He spoke about how SAS used analytics to effectively share data around the pandemic with the public using free dashboards.He shared that their objective as an organisation is to improve lives by making better decisions and they do it by providing a wide range of tech-driven solutions to their customers.Nutapone then went into detail about other the incredible projects done by SAS in the financial sector industry. These initiatives support areas like digital transformation, customer experience, risk management and fraud & security management.Making it relatable for the audience, he delved deeper into fraud & security management solutions. Elaborating the myriad of ways in which it can help financial organisations including monitoring, conduct assurance, financial intel and compliance, market and trade surveillance.He concluded by highlighting SAS’s strength as leaders in the field; not only do they only have solutions for payment fraud and anti-money laundering but are champions in data and analytics.After Nutapone’s presentation, Ahmed Drissi, Anti-money laundering lead- APAC for SAS shared more details into the SAS money laundering Solution.Ahmed began by talking about the challenges in using the traditional AML solutions; key among these is their inability to cope with the high volume of online transactions. Ahmed then explained how their solutions can help overcome these challenges.He spoke about other stakeholders in the industries, like regulators, who also recognise the benefits of using AI and ML in anti-money laundering initiatives. These stakeholders are now whole-heartedly encouraging the use of these technologies in the field.He supported this by sharing examples of financial regulatory authorities in the USA, UK, and Singapore have started recommending the use of AI and ML in the context of anti-money laundering.Ahmed went on to share a visual graphic representation of the three phases of AI and ML adoption cycle as done by large global and regional banks. The three phases are Innovation, Adoption and Maturity.This phased approach was a key insight into how SAS helped organisations improve operational efficiency and reduce false positives.He also enumerated various AI and ML use cases in AML that include: entity resolution, customer segmentation, post alert scoring, model detection, tuning and optimisation.In concluding, he presented a bouquet of SAS offerings – Financial Crimes Analytics Solutions – that help monitor and prevent fraud incidence in the organisations.After Ahmed, Viswanathan Namasivayam, advisor for Data Science Enterprise Architecture, Data and AI group at UnionBank Philippines shared his expert opinion on the topic.Viswanathan started by pointing out the need for banks and financial institutions to make compliance simplified and robust in light of ever-increasing fraud and hacking incidents.He highlighted the power of advanced tech like AI and ML. Its efficacy lies in its ability to go beyond a single representation of an individual or an entity rendering a better understanding of fraud risk.He also emphasised the fact that using tech in regulation and security is non-negotiable and validated this stance with a recent case study from Germany.To further underscore his point, he shared how supervisors and regulators of the industry are also implementing and encouraging the use of new tech.He concluded by pointing at the significant paradigm shift in organisations’ approach in handling fraud incidences from initiating action after something irregular has been detected to taking actions to prevent the fraud risk.Viswanathan was confident that this is was a big step for organisations on their journey towards having a robust risk and fraud management system.After this powerful presentation, it was time for the polling question session to get all the delegates involved in the discussion.On the first question regarding major challenges faced during AML investigation process, the Thai audience was split between High rates of false positives (41%) and Lack of data/insights around customers, accounts and entities (41%).A senior delegate from a major bank shared that not only is the data insufficient, it also lacks accuracy, which makes the investigation very challenging. Furthermore, fraud investigation is not an isolated process, it requires analysing data not just during the time of the incident but also from the surrounding blocks of time. Thus, insufficiency and inaccuracy of data become significant challenges.It was interesting to see that the response to this question in Thailand was along the same lines as it was in the Singapore session. There too, a majority of delegates voted for high rates of false positives (44%) while the rest of the responses saw an equally distributed portion of votes.In regard to the next question about the areas that would benefit most from the use of AI and ML the audience was divided among all the available options but two of them accounted for over half the group: Alert triage and risk prioritisation (27%) and Automated disposition of alerts(27%).A senior compliance officer from a public sector bank shared that she voted for Alert triage and risk prioritisation as in this area, AI can help automise a lot of procedures and processes making them speedier and more efficient. This makes overall work progress fast.The response to this question in the Singapore session featured an almost equal distribution of responses over all the available options as opposed to a clear inclination towards anyone of them.On the final question of the expected time to complete an investigation with regards to the enhanced due diligence process, a majority of the audience voted between 30-60 minutes (40%).When asked for a reflection, another on of our delegate shared that using AI/ML can really help speed up the investigation process, but it also partly depends on how quickly can you get the information from your customer. If your case management system allows you to communicate directly with the customer and get the information embedded in the case, that can really speed up the process too.It was interesting to observe that when the same question was asked to the Singapore delegates, many shared that they spend more than 24 hours to complete an investigation  – pointing to an urgent need for AI/ML-driven solutions.After the polling session, Ahmed concluded the session with closing remarks. He thanked all the delegates for their time and participation in the event. He said that adopting tech in regulation requires laser light focus – something that SAS champions. He encouraged delegates to engage and collaborate with them if they are working towards it.",https://opengovasia.com/ai-and-advanced-analytics-can-help-champion-next-generation-compliance-in-the-financial-sector-industry/,http://opengovasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Group-pic-20th-August.png

"Bihar, India uses AI for the early detection of floods			",Article has not blurp,"This year’s floods in the eastern state of Bihar affected over 8.1 million people in July. According to the Bihar Disaster Management Department (BDMD), the ongoing floods inundated 16 districts across the state and hit 1,310 village councils. For better crisis management, the Bihar government started deploying an artificial intelligence-based early warning system and a mathematical modelling system.According to a The use of the early warning system has led to fewer flood-related deaths as people can be better prepared. The district administrations and residents are getting adequate time to move to safer places, carrying out their maximum belongings and livestock. This year, Bihar started using the services of its Flood Management Improvement Support Centre (FMISC). The centre has a newly-established mathematical modelling centre (MMC) under the centre of excellence for water resources, research, and development.The centre has developed a flood forecast model with a 72-hour lead time for rivers like Gandak, Bagmati-Adhwara, Kamala, Kosi, and Mahananda, which originate in Nepal. The centre also assesses the Ganga starting between Buxar and Kahalgaon. With mathematical modelling, AI, a personal locator beacon, and machine learning (ML), the centre assesses precipitation, humidity, temperature, and the last seven days’ hydrological data and three days’ forecasted hydrological data to provide a weather forecast, the report noted.Earlier this month, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) announced its plan to IMD uses different tools like radars and satellite imagery, to issue nowcasts, which provide information on extreme weather events occurring in the next 3-6 hours. IMD issues forecasts for extreme weather events like thunderstorms and dust storms. Unlike cyclones, predictions of thunderstorms, which also bring lightning, squall, and heavy rains, are more difficult as the extreme weather events develop and dissipate in a very short period.Last month, over 160 people died due to lightning alone in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The IMD wants to better the nowcast predictions through AI and ML, which will help understanding past weather models and speed up decision-making. Technology to accurately predict and anticipate a crisis is not just necessary for governments but businesses as well.

HKU team codevelops new data storage method			,Article has not blurp,"The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning techniques is changing the world dramatically with novel applications such as the internet of things, autonomous vehicles, real-time imaging processing and big data analytics in healthcare.In 2020, the global data volume is estimated to reach 44 Zettabytes and will continue to grow beyond the current capacity of computing and storage devices. At the same time, the related electricity consumption will increase 15 times by 2030, swallowing 8% of the global energy demand. Therefore, the need to reduce energy consumption and increase the speed of information storage technology is urgent.Berkeley researchers led by the HKU President (when he was in Berkeley), in collaboration with a team at Stanford University, announced that they have The researchers creatively make use of quantum geometry: Berry curvature, to read information out. Therefore, this material platform works ideally for memory, with independent ‘write’ and ‘read’ operation. The energy consumption using this novel data storage method can be over 100 times less than the traditional method.This work is a conceptual innovation for non-volatile storage types and can potentially bring technological revolution. For the first time, the researchers prove that two-dimensional semi-metals, going beyond traditional silicon material, can be used for information storage and reading. The team’s work was published in the latest issue of the journal Compared with the existing non-volatile (NVW) memory, this new material platform is expected to increase storage speed by two orders and decrease energy cost by three orders, and it can greatly facilitate the realization of emerging in-memory computing and neural network computing.The research was inspired by the research of the HKU Professor’s team on “Structural phase transition of single-layer MoTe2 driven by electrostatic doping”, published in Previously, researchers found that in the two-dimensional material-tungsten ditelluride, when the material is in a topological state, the special arrangement of atoms in these layers can produce so-called “Weyl nodes”, which will exhibit unique electronic properties, such as zero resistance conduction. These points are considered to have wormhole-like characteristics, where electrons tunnel between opposite surfaces of the material.In previous experiments, the researchers found that the material structure can be adjusted by terahertz radiation pulse, thereby quickly switching between the topological and non-topological states of the material, effectively turning the zero-resistance state off and then on again.The team led by the HKU President has proved that the atomic-level thickness of two-dimensional materials greatly reduces the screening effect of the electric field, and its structure is easily affected by the electron concentration or electric field. Therefore, topological materials at the two-dimensional limit can allow the turning of optical manipulation into electrical control, paving towards electronic devices.In this work, the researchers stacked three atomic layers of tungsten ditelluride metal layers, like a nanoscale deck of cards. By injecting a small number of carriers into the stack or applying a vertical electric field, they caused each odd-numbered layer to slide laterally relative to the even-numbered layers above and below it. Through the corresponding optical and electrical characterizations, they observed that this slip is permanent until another electrical excitation triggers layers to rearrange. Furthermore, to read the data and information stored between these moving atomic layers, the researchers used the extremely large “Berry curvature” in the semi-metallic material. This quantum characteristic is like a magnetic field, which can steer electrons’ propagation and result in nonlinear Hall effect. Through such an effect, the arrangement of the atomic layer can be read without disturbing the stacking.Using this quantum characteristic, different stacks and metal polarization states can be distinguished well. This discovery solves the long-term reading difficulty in ferroelectric metals due to their weak polarization. This makes ferroelectric metals not only interesting in basic physical exploration but also proves that such materials may have applicational prospects comparable to conventional semiconductors and ferroelectric insulators. Changing the stacking orders only involves the breaking of the Van der Waals bond.Therefore, the energy consumption is theoretically two orders of magnitude lower than the energy consumed by breaking the covalent bond in traditional phase change materials and provides a new platform for the development of more energy-efficient storage devices and helps us move towards a sustainable and smart future.",https://opengovasia.com/hku-team-codevelops-new-data-storage-method/,http://opengovasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Article_2-Sept-2020_1-HK.jpg
Governments should deploy AI and Analytics to derive useful insights from troves of collected data			,Article has not blurp,"On 21 August 2020 OpenGov Asia organised another highly interactive OpenGovLive! session to inform and empower delegates from a wide spectrum of government agencies in Thailand.As governments around the world struggle to cope with these stressful times, OpenGov Asia supports them by sharing knowledge on how technology and analytics can help better manage people and nations. The overwhelming attendance and engagement from the Thailand audience was itself a testimonial to the relevance of the topic.The session opened with a presentation by Mohit Sagar, Group Managing Director and Editor-in-Chief at OpenGov Asia.Mohit opined that the world is at a crucial point right just now and the decisions governments take currently will shape the way the future looks.With almost every city shut down or constrained as a result of the pandemic, public services were one sector that was under a lot of pressure; ensuring all citizens had access to basic amenities to survive the lockdown and stay safe.However, not all services were seeing the same kind of demand, making it critical for governments to identify high priority areas and act accordingly.During the last few months, governments have also collected a huge trove of data. Driving insights from this data can help them validate decisions for current and future needs.Not only do governments need to analyse the huge volumes of data, but they also need to rethink their policies and practices in these unprecedented times. They no longer just need to respond to the pandemic and recover from it, they must also learn to and plan to thrive in these times.Mohit emphasised deploying the latest technology and data analytics tools as a smart and effective way of doing things. He also highlighted that the technology will be effective only when complemented with sound leadership.He concluded by advising the governments and public sector executives to partner with the champions in technology and use their expertise to serve citizens better.After Mohit’s presentation, Nutapone Apiluktiyanut, Managing Director, SAS Thailand came forward to share his perspectives with delegates.Nutapone briefly introduced the audience to SAS and its mission of improving lives through better decision making.He then shared his observations about the phased approach being followed by governments in tackling the pandemic and how SAS’s data analytics tools support that.Nutapone presented the three stages highlighted by him:To expound on the Respond Stage, he talked about collaboration with governments in India and the United States to predict their medical infrastructure requirements using SAS’s data analytics.Similarly, during the Recovery Stage, SAS worked closely with government agencies to prepare them as they were getting ready to reopen their economies. Data analytics helped governments determine their revenue streams, expenses and distribution patterns of stimulus packages.Nutapone closed by saying that SAS technology can help governments Reimagine the future – to be better prepared for the next emergency well in advance, avoiding loss to lives and resources.After Nutapone, Joseph Musolino, Global Sales and Strategy Consultant Fraud and Security Intelligence, SAS spoke on the topic from another angle.Joseph began by sharing interesting statistics that pointed to the fact that organisations globally consider Machine Learning and AI the most significant data initiative for the next year.Joseph felt that the focus for these countries should now be to take AI and Analytics to enterprises and make both these technologies faster and easier to deploy.He highlighted some of the areas where governments are currently deploying advanced analytics to strengthen their delivery mechanisms. They include – Customs, Pandemics, Medical, Taxation and Judicial systems.In order to give the audience a detailed understanding of how exactly the theory plays out, he demonstrated real-life situations where analytics had helped governments serve citizens better.He concluded by informing the delegates about their new platform which is a step forward into next-gen analytics.After Joseph’s presentation, Evelyn Wareham, Chief Data and Insights Officer at the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, New Zealand shared her insights on the topic. Her goal was to update all the delegates on the latest developments in data strategy in New Zealand Public sector and specifically in the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.She began by stating New Zealand’s current vision for data strategy, i.e. a future where data is regarded as an essential part of New Zealand’s infrastructure and where data use is underpinned by public trust and confidence. In the same vein, she also shared the major aims of this vision that include:Evelyn then spoke about New Zealand’s strong integrated data infrastructure that brings together steams of information from Tax, Housing, Census, Education, Benefits, etc. that helps the government make wise policy decisions for the country.This integrated data structure is of particular importance in the Business, Innovation and Employment Ministry as it helps track indicators of economic growth of the nation.The aim of this data and the insights are to help the government formulate policy; analytics helps enhance service experience, build operational intel for compliance and enhances performance.Evelyn also shared some examples of how they are using data analytics currently. During the different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic the government was relying on the various real-time data resources that helped them gauge the status economy and take decisions accordingly.One example of this is the data on spending that was tracked that helped the government identify the requirements and make suitable fiscal provisions.Another example of this was a graph that helped the government see how businesses were coping with the pandemic and how it was impacting them.The last example Evelyn shared was keeping track of travel data across borders to ensure the safety of people in New Zealand.She concluded by saying that the country is still on a journey towards becoming perfect in using data and analytics to serve the public better.After Evelyn’s informative presentation, it was time for the polling session. The delegates showed great interest and engagement during the session.On the first question of the biggest impact on your organisation as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic, a majority of delegates (42%) voted for workforce planning and the need to test resilience of working remotely in both long and short term.A delegate shared that working from home has been the biggest impact on almost all organisations as nobody was expecting it and they were not prepared for it either. Providing the right infrastructure and ensuring a strong network for all employees as they log in to the systems at the same time was a huge challenge for their organisation.On the next question of the area where your organisation needs to develop most to respond more efficiently to the next pandemic of such magnitude, the audience was split between integrated operations models to keep the government running (37%) and use of data and analytics to improve situational awareness for real-time decision making (31%).A delegate shared that they voted for use of data and analytics to improve situational awareness for real-time decision making as governments in this region do not use analysis as much as they ideally should. Using analytics would speed up fundamental processes, giving them more time to work on more complex things.On the final question of major change in how your department/organisation works due to COVID-19, most of the delegates voted for increased digitisation of back-office administration and processes (55%).A senior delegate reflected that before using data analytics and advanced technology in our operations, we need to improve our back-office functions from manual to digital. Once that is updated, we can deploy AI/ML or machine learning to enhance our performance.After the polling session, Joseph addressed the audience with concluding remarks. He thanked and appreciated the audience for taking time out of their busy schedules. He also said that they have only touched the tip of the iceberg for this topic and there is so much to share and discuss.He encouraged delegates to reach out and engage in more discussions about analytics and the surrounding ecosystem.",https://opengovasia.com/governments-should-deploy-ai-and-analytics-to-derive-useful-insights-from-troves-of-collected-data/,http://opengovasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Group-Pic-Agust-21Resized.png
AI and Advanced analytics can help champion next generation compliance in the financial sector industry			,Article has not blurp,"Continuing its series of sessions with the financial sector industry across ASEAN, OpenGov Asia hosted its third OpenGovLive! Virtual Breakfast Insight with delegates from Thailand on 20 August 2020.The event once again saw a 100% attendance and a great level of involvement from the audience on the topic of Understanding the importance of compliance and risk management for the financial industry in these tough times and the urgency of deploying tech in this process was the major focus of the varied insights from delegates and speakers.The session was opened by Mohit Sagar, Group Managing Director and Editor-in-Chief at OpenGov Asia.Mohit shed light on the harsh reality of the times where everybody is masking data. Further, the danger from threat actors is becoming more and more sophisticated.These cybercriminals are leveraging advanced technology with a destructive mindset and without any constraints of regulation or compliance.Financial organisations cannot afford to lag behind in keeping up with the latest technological developments in the field if they want to protect themselves and simultaneously outdo adversaries to survive.On the issue of compliance, Mohit felt that it had to be seen as a part of the big picture and not seen in isolation. Compliance must be part of a robust framework that necessitates using AI and Analytics to derive desired and clean outcomes.However, it is important to understand that technology can only augment existing human resources, not replace them.He concluded by stressing the need for focused leadership and the need to collaborate with partners who champion the field of technology.After Mohit, Nutapone Apiluktoyanunt, Managing Director, SAS Thailand shared his views on the topic with the audience.Nutapone began by introducing the company and given a brief overview of the work globally. He spoke about how SAS used analytics to effectively share data around the pandemic with the public using free dashboards.He shared that their objective as an organisation is to improve lives by making better decisions and they do it by providing a wide range of tech-driven solutions to their customers.Nutapone then went into detail about other the incredible projects done by SAS in the financial sector industry. These initiatives support areas like digital transformation, customer experience, risk management and fraud & security management.Making it relatable for the audience, he delved deeper into fraud & security management solutions. Elaborating the myriad of ways in which it can help financial organisations including monitoring, conduct assurance, financial intel and compliance, market and trade surveillance.He concluded by highlighting SAS’s strength as leaders in the field; not only do they only have solutions for payment fraud and anti-money laundering but are champions in data and analytics.After Nutapone’s presentation, Ahmed Drissi, Anti-money laundering lead- APAC for SAS shared more details into the SAS money laundering Solution.Ahmed began by talking about the challenges in using the traditional AML solutions; key among these is their inability to cope with the high volume of online transactions. Ahmed then explained how their solutions can help overcome these challenges.He spoke about other stakeholders in the industries, like regulators, who also recognise the benefits of using AI and ML in anti-money laundering initiatives. These stakeholders are now whole-heartedly encouraging the use of these technologies in the field.He supported this by sharing examples of financial regulatory authorities in the USA, UK, and Singapore have started recommending the use of AI and ML in the context of anti-money laundering.Ahmed went on to share a visual graphic representation of the three phases of AI and ML adoption cycle as done by large global and regional banks. The three phases are Innovation, Adoption and Maturity.This phased approach was a key insight into how SAS helped organisations improve operational efficiency and reduce false positives.He also enumerated various AI and ML use cases in AML that include: entity resolution, customer segmentation, post alert scoring, model detection, tuning and optimisation.In concluding, he presented a bouquet of SAS offerings – Financial Crimes Analytics Solutions – that help monitor and prevent fraud incidence in the organisations.After Ahmed, Viswanathan Namasivayam, advisor for Data Science Enterprise Architecture, Data and AI group at UnionBank Philippines shared his expert opinion on the topic.Viswanathan started by pointing out the need for banks and financial institutions to make compliance simplified and robust in light of ever-increasing fraud and hacking incidents.He highlighted the power of advanced tech like AI and ML. Its efficacy lies in its ability to go beyond a single representation of an individual or an entity rendering a better understanding of fraud risk.He also emphasised the fact that using tech in regulation and security is non-negotiable and validated this stance with a recent case study from Germany.To further underscore his point, he shared how supervisors and regulators of the industry are also implementing and encouraging the use of new tech.He concluded by pointing at the significant paradigm shift in organisations’ approach in handling fraud incidences from initiating action after something irregular has been detected to taking actions to prevent the fraud risk.Viswanathan was confident that this is was a big step for organisations on their journey towards having a robust risk and fraud management system.After this powerful presentation, it was time for the polling question session to get all the delegates involved in the discussion.On the first question regarding major challenges faced during AML investigation process, the Thai audience was split between High rates of false positives (41%) and Lack of data/insights around customers, accounts and entities (41%).A senior delegate from a major bank shared that not only is the data insufficient, it also lacks accuracy, which makes the investigation very challenging. Furthermore, fraud investigation is not an isolated process, it requires analysing data not just during the time of the incident but also from the surrounding blocks of time. Thus, insufficiency and inaccuracy of data become significant challenges.It was interesting to see that the response to this question in Thailand was along the same lines as it was in the Singapore session. There too, a majority of delegates voted for high rates of false positives (44%) while the rest of the responses saw an equally distributed portion of votes.In regard to the next question about the areas that would benefit most from the use of AI and ML the audience was divided among all the available options but two of them accounted for over half the group: Alert triage and risk prioritisation (27%) and Automated disposition of alerts(27%).A senior compliance officer from a public sector bank shared that she voted for Alert triage and risk prioritisation as in this area, AI can help automise a lot of procedures and processes making them speedier and more efficient. This makes overall work progress fast.The response to this question in the Singapore session featured an almost equal distribution of responses over all the available options as opposed to a clear inclination towards anyone of them.On the final question of the expected time to complete an investigation with regards to the enhanced due diligence process, a majority of the audience voted between 30-60 minutes (40%).When asked for a reflection, another on of our delegate shared that using AI/ML can really help speed up the investigation process, but it also partly depends on how quickly can you get the information from your customer. If your case management system allows you to communicate directly with the customer and get the information embedded in the case, that can really speed up the process too.It was interesting to observe that when the same question was asked to the Singapore delegates, many shared that they spend more than 24 hours to complete an investigation  – pointing to an urgent need for AI/ML-driven solutions.After the polling session, Ahmed concluded the session with closing remarks. He thanked all the delegates for their time and participation in the event. He said that adopting tech in regulation requires laser light focus – something that SAS champions. He encouraged delegates to engage and collaborate with them if they are working towards it.",https://opengovasia.com/ai-and-advanced-analytics-can-help-champion-next-generation-compliance-in-the-financial-sector-industry/,http://opengovasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Group-pic-20th-August.png

The Philippines government to utilise Advanced Data and Analytics to solve overcome data sharing and connectivity challenges			,Article has not blurp,"OpenGov Asia organised another successful Virtual Breakfast Insight as a part of its public sector series in the Philippines with delegates from various a wide spectrum of government agencies. Held on 6Mohit Sagar, Group Managing Director and Editor-in-Chief, OpenGov Asia, set the tone for the discussion by highlighting the pain and pressure on governments over the last four 4 months.Governments are dedicating all their energy and resources to provide whatever is necessary to maximise the wellbeing of its citizens.Even as governments have been working hard to protect residents, they have been collecting huge volumes of data from the general public. This data has been for logistical purposes, tracking and tracing, infection control and overall citizen care.In such times, Mohit said, the role of leaders becomes very important. Leaders not only manage the response to the crisis but also the recovery and path to a better future.Technology is a powerful tool to communicate and connect with people and has the potential to lead to a better life ahead.Mohit concluded his opening on an optimistic note, pointing out that in a crisis danger and opportunity coexist.With the right mindset and right people around, one can capitalise on opportunities that present themselves.After Mohit, Ryan Guadalquiver, Country Manager for SAS Philippines presented his unique and informative perspective. Ryan began by sharing his organisation’s view on how they see governments handling the current crisis due to COVID–19.He explained the process as phased approach with the following 3 stages:To expound on the Respond stage, he shared about collaboration with governments in India and the United States to predict their medical infrastructure requirements using SAS’s data analytics.Similarly, during the Recovery stage, SAS worked closely with government agencies to prepare them as they were getting ready to reopen their economies.He then threw some light on SAS’s legacy of working with government agencies and helping them solve problems.Ryan gave examples of recent work done with different organisations to support them in serving citizens during the pandemic to help the country recover economically. Some of these organisations include Southern Philippines Medical Centre, Globe Telecoms and few other agencies.After Ryan, Joseph Musolino, Global Sales and Strategy Consultant Fraud and Security Intelligence, SAS spoke on the topic from another angle.Joseph began by sharing interesting statistics that pointed to the fact that organisations globally consider Machine learning and AI as the most significant data initiatives for the next year.Joseph opined that the focus for these countries should now be to take AI and Analytics to enterprises and make both these technologies faster and easier to deploy.He highlighted some of the areas where governments are currently deploying advanced analytics to strengthen their delivery mechanisms.They include – Customs, Pandemics, Medical, Taxation and Judicial systems.In order to give the audience a detailed understanding of how exactly the theory plays out, he demonstrated real-life situations where analytics had helped the government serve citizens better.He concluded by informing the delegates about their new platform which is a step forward into next-gen analytics.After Joseph’s useful insights, Rowan Dollar, Chief Information Officer, Department of Human Services (SA) shared his thoughts and learnings with the delegates. He shared a video on how AI and advanced tech are helping protect the marine life in Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia.This is a true example of the government utilising technology to innovate and solving a major environmental problem.The naturally rich Darwin reef had so many different species of marine life that were not known to authorities. This prevented them from conserving these species and taking proper care of the natural habitat.They decided to use AI-powered cameras that enabled observing, identifying and counting different fish species through the coloured water and other particulate matter in it. This use of technology helped the government better understand marine life and allocate the resources in the right direction.After Rowan’s presentation, the session proceeded to the interactive polling session where delegates responded to a series of questions.On the question of the area in your organisation that needs to develop most to respond more efficiently to the next COVID – 19,  the audience was split between answer (2) integrated operations model to keep the government running efficiently and sustainably (30%) and answer (3) use of data and analytics to improve situational awareness for real-time decision making (36%).A senior delegate from the Philippines Customs Department shared that he voted for (3). The department had initially loosened the flow of medical supplies and equipment in and out of the country during the pandemic but realised that it increased the risk of illegal trade activities.Using analytics helped them identify and work out the discrepancies in the demand and supply of certain goods and services in the country.On the next question of how the pandemic has changed how your agency/department functions, the audience showed a mixed response between answer (1) more reliant on social/communication technology (37%) and answer (4) understanding how to mobilise our workforce to support working from home (28%).A delegate from the National Economic and Development Authority reflected that he voted for (4) as he felt it important to make sure that people’s efficiency was not getting impacted adversely. This requires making sure that they have access to the right kind of technology to do that.On the final question: if advanced analytics and AI are a higher priority of your organisation as a result of the COVID – 19 pandemic, the audience was split between Strongly Agree (37%) and Agree (46%).A senior member from the Philippines Charity Sweepstakes Office shared that all government agencies want to use data and analytics in their functions, but procurement becomes an issue. Governments are under a lot of scrutiny to make sure that the privacy of citizens’ data is not compromised.The session then came to a conclusion with closing remarks from Joseph. He highlighted major data-related and connectivity challenges in the Philippines and how a focused approach could solve the multiple problems around them. He thanked all the delegates and speakers for contributing to the event and adding to each other’s knowledge on the subject.",https://opengovasia.com/the-philippines-government-to-utilise-advanced-data-and-analytics-to-solve-overcome-data-sharing-and-connectivity-challenges/,http://opengovasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rsz_2live_audience_58.png
New digitalisation platform launches in HK			,Article has not blurp,"The latest solution by a firm within the Hong Kong Smart Government Innovation Lab is now ready to be acquired by companies and institutions.Solution descriptionThe The platform allows users of different roles to streamline the business approval process, control records access permission control, set scheduling jobs, notifications, reminders, upload or download files, pre-defined tailor-made reports or charts, etc. It supports better controlling for Government staff to manage internal processes at scale. The deployment supports both cloud or on-premises use. The solution’s existing clients consist of several governmental agencies including OGCIO, HKPC, Cyberport, HK Electric, HKUST and more.Application AreasThe solution was developed to applied in the areas of Broadcasting, City Management, Climate and Weather, Commerce and Industry, Development, Education, Employment and Labour, Environment, Finance, Food, Health, Housing, Law and Security, Population, Recreation and Culture, Social Welfare as well as Transport.Technologies UsedThe solution uses the latest in Cloud Computing, Internet of Things (IoT), Mobile Technologies and no-coding platform/HPaPaaS.Use casesPublic Sector Use Case 1: The firm helped digitise over 100 forms in 3 months instead of one year by coding. The e-forms and processes are maintained by the organisation’s staff. After being deployed with the DragOnce platform, the IT team can easily digitise all paper forms with an agile methodology and consolidates all forms in a unified platform. A unified platform allows organisations to centralise all forms into one single data source, lowering the data integrity problem caused by the manual error.Since there is no one-size-fits-all solution in terms of a single org chart structure for every enterprise, the DragOnce platform is designed to handle any structure of org chart and allows administrators to set permission controls on each level of user. With the permission controls, organisations can easily control the data accessibility on all end-users and ensure data security. This costs between HK$500,000 to HK$1.3 million.Public Sector Use Case 2The firm in need approached the tech company seeking an internal procurement system that could emancipate them from the manual purchasing process (excel spreadsheets, email, phone calls, sign-on print-out papers, etc). The system needed to be able to handle vendor management, quotation requests, purchase requests, purchase orders, approval processing, delivery schedule checks, purchase invoice checking and inventory management.The platform developed by the tech firm met these requirements and allows for multiple-level approval, permission controls on end-users and dynamic workflows. After implementation, the system speeds up processes three times and allows users to easily monitor the status of procurement processes and vendor management. The cost is between HK$500,000 to HK$1.3 million.Private Sector Use Case 3: Electric Utility Company This electric utility company requires massive amounts of workflow data to be handled daily business processes. Thanks to the effort of the firm’s IT Team, the workflow request from the employees can be managed, but still, there are plenty of IT application requests from various Business Units and it is time-consuming to get through the traditional Software Development Life Cycle to deploy one application.The company needs a solution to lower the workload for the IT team. DragOnce offers end-user computing solutions to them. This company needs a no-code platform to tackle the problem of numerous workflow requests on IT.With a no-code platform, all employees can build their internal mobile applications easily without spending lots of developing time and no programming language is required.End-user computing empowers the companys’ employees. When everyone, even non-IT employees, can build their application with few clicks, the IT team can finally focus more on critical projects. This not only results in higher productivity of the IT team but also encourages innovation in the company. All employees can now make use of their innovative ideas to build their own systems based on their understanding of the business flow. Thanks to end-user computing, the system created is 100% suitable for the end-users. The cost is between HK$500,00 to HK$1.3 million.",https://opengovasia.com/new-digitalisation-platform-launches-in-hk/,http://opengovasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Article_17-Aug-2020_1-HK.jpg
Work begins on new HK data centre			,Article has not blurp,"A real estate investment trust that invests in carrier-neutral data centres and provides colocation and peering services is HKG11 will be a 21,000 square metres (210,000 square feet) building and hold up to a 24MW of IT capacity. It is expected to be online in mid-2021, around the same time as Digital Realty’s upcoming Seoul facility in South Korea.In 2012, Digital Realty acquired its first Hong Kong data centre on the Tseung Kwan O industrial estate, HKG10, capable of up to 18MW of IT capacity.Its planned sister facility, HKG11, is located at the nearby but separate Kwai Chung district in Hong Kong and will operate as an auxiliary to HKG10.The Chief Executive Officer of the firm stated that its investment in Hong Kong is another important milestone on its global platform road map, enabling customers’ digital transformation strategies while demonstrating its commitment to supporting their future growth on PlatformDIGITAL.As the firm continues to expand in Asia, the launch of the second facility in Hong Kong underscores its importance as a major data hub, providing customers with the coverage, capacity, and connectivity requirements to support their digital ambitions.The HKG11 facility will be built up to a total of 12 floors, eight of which will be dedicated to customer deployments.The firm’s MD for the Asia Pacific region noted that Hong Kong is a regional leader in cloud readiness and has significant potential for further cloud adoption along with a strong base of customers with an appetite for digital technologies.He stated. “We are delighted to launch our new facility, which will go a long way towards meeting the rapidly growing demand and bringing value to customers across the region, especially from China.”Aside from Hong Kong, Digital Realty is also establishing facilities in Tokyo, Osaka, Singapore, Sydney, and Melbourne.Hong Kong – a data centre hubIn February 2020, OpenGov Asia The aim is to boost network performance for end-users throughout China and across the APAC region.The addition of new local and international connectivity partners has improved network performance and reliability for businesses seeking to reach one of Asia’s busiest centres or international finance, trade, and enterprise.The data centre market in the Asia Pacific has been forecasted to reach US$32 billion by 2023, behind only North America in terms of regional revenue.According to the findings of a data analytics and consulting company, the surge in spending during the next four years will stem from enterprise customers “increasingly migrating” existing resources to data centres to “reap benefits from data”.By 2023, Asia Pacific will account for nearly 30 per cent of the global data centre market, behind North America with 34.2 per cent but ahead of Western Europe on 24 per cent.The lead analyst on the report stated that the data centre and hosting market growth in the Asia Pacific will be driven by growing demand for cloud services and digitisation from both enterprises as well as the investors.Investment will continue in new data centre projects by existing and new entrants with a view to expand their presence in the region and serve additional customers.In addition, with the commercial availability of 5G services in the next 1-2 years, data consumption is expected to grow multiple-folds.This will result in constant connectivity requirements as well as data centre supported features, for supporting the critical business applications and activities of the enterprises.",https://opengovasia.com/work-begins-on-new-hk-data-centre/,http://opengovasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Article_5-July-2020_1-HK.jpg
Governments to adopt Cloud Data Management for high performance in digital environment			,Article has not blurp,"Governments are exceptional institutions that did not slow down during the pandemic. Although not all of their services were essential during the crisis, some were in high demand by default.All over the world, governments are packed with great volumes of data that is hard to make sense of in their current setting. Primarily because it is unstructured but also because much is on legacy systems that are not accessible or compatible to modern infrastructure.Merely hoarding data is not useful nor valuable. Data needs to be organised, analysed and should make sense if crucial decisions are based on it.In light of this, OpenGov Asia held another Virtual Breakfast Insight: High-performance Digital Government – Intelligent Cloud Data Management Strategies on 25 June 2020.The high-level session had a cross section of chief information officers and IT heads from various government and public sector organisations in Singapore, Malaysia and India. All joined in to discuss Simple, Scalable and Seamless Cloud Data Management for a high-performance digital government.Mohit Sagar, Group Managing Director and Editor- in-chief at OpenGov Asia opened the session with thought-provoking insights into Cloud Data Management.Mohit explained that data management is a process that might look like a herculean task especially in such a busy time for the government. Breaking it down in smaller bits makes it easier to implement and practice.He advised the delegates to set manageable goals for future and focus on those rather than trying fix the mountains of unstructured data from the past.And this is where cloud becomes relevant. It offers a simple, seamless, and scalable solution to data storage problems.Organisations no longer have to worry about the location of valuable data in physical data centres. Cloud enables accessing data from multiple points remotely.However, enabling remote access to data from multiple points has not been the natural structure of government organisations. It was necessitated by the pandemic.Mohit also cautioned the audience that security of data in cloud is very important otherwise the data is prone to breaches and misuse.He concluded by saying that government institutions should be open to adopting new technology as it will help them become more efficient and effective in serving public.Raymond Goh, Director of Systems Engineering, Veeam shared his view that all organisations, be it public or private, are gradually getting more inclined towards a customer/citizen centric approach in their operations. Their data management strategies are also in line with that.Keeping data classified is highly important for the organisations otherwise it can create impediments in growth and make data complex. It can also make compliance and security hard to achieve.Apart from making operations difficult, unmanaged data can incur unnecessary costs for the organisations and loss of customer confidence.Raymond shared key points in the process of cloud data management from ensuring backup and recovery to the last important bit about compliance with regulations.He then moved to articulate state the three critical aspects for organisations to focus on in their cloud data management journey:Having understood the importance of Data Management in cloud, Chris Buxton, Chief Digital Officer at Stats New Zealand threw light on how management of data over the cloud can be more effective than the traditional approach to storing data.He shared some useful insights from his experience of rapidly transitioning to a cloud-based environment.Chris believes that managing data on cloud is not very different from the traditional way of managing data.Additionally, it opens a new range of capability and connectedness that is not available in the old way.In this age of technology, data is are no longer being generated manually; technology is being leveraged to collect and harvest the data from the web. This, in turn, makes collaboration and storage easier.Conversely at the same time, huge amounts of data are being ingested – making it crucial to ensure that all the data and content all secure. As such, data security becomes an integral part of Cloud data management.Chris re-emphasised five key areas that were highlighted by Raymond earlier: security, compliance, cost management, automation, performance and monitoring.Chris concluded by sharing the various steps to be undertaken as organisations begin their journey towards cloud data management.He completed the circle beginning from having a plan to governing your data.After Chris’s presentation the session went into a more interactive phase with polling questions for the attendees.On the first question on how long an IT outage lasts in their organisations, delegates were divided between less than 15 mins (36%) and 16 – 60 mins (26%).An IT executive from Malaysia shared that she voted for 1- 4 hours as the average time. She opined that the duration varies and is dependent on how critical the application in question is.Her opinion was totally in line with the findings that Raymond shared from the recent survey conducted by Veeam. On average, in most organisations, IT outage does not last more than 2 hours.Moving forward, the next question was about the primary reasons for IT outages in an organisation. On this majority of the audience voted for Infrastructure and networking (60%).A senior executive from insurance sector shared that they faced several IT outages when their organisation moved to a remote working model. With a staff of 3000 employees, working remotely put a lot of pressure on their networks and infrastructure.Raymond concurred with him as the Veaam survey also showed infrastructure failure as the major reason for outages besides cybersecurity threats and application software failures.On the final question about why digital transformation is important for an organisation, the participants, for the most part, leaned towards transforming business operations and processes (50%) and transforming customer services (35%).A delegate from India shared that transforming business processes is definitely the primary driving force behind digital transformation. However, it is still important to be mindful of the limitations of budgets.The survey reflected similar trends with transforming customer services to be the top motivation for digital transformation followed by transforming business processes.The interactive Q&A session offered a plethora of reflections and insights from delegates. This rich dialogue was extremely beneficial. It allowed the participants to understand cloud data management from diverse perspectives that were set in a range of contexts and settings.Raymond concluded the session by urging organisations to take the next step in their digital transformation journey and urged them to work towards the four C’s he mentioned in his presentation.Delegates of OpenGov Asia’s Virtual Breakfast Insight gained key insights from the digital experts who presented. They were left better informed by the diverse perspectives of each other on digital transformation and using cloud technologies to manage their data.",https://opengovasia.com/governments-to-adopt-cloud-data-management-for-high-performance-in-digital-environment/,http://opengovasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/veeam-Hero-image-Blurred-scaled-e1593599807470.jpg
DICT amends Philippine Cloud First Policy			,Article has not blurp,"The It also covers policies on sovereignty, residency, and ownership as the government transitions to the ‘new normal’ amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.In a Shifting to cloud computing is expected to foster flexibility, security, and cost-efficiency among users. Cloud computing also offers key advantages such as access to global systems of solutions, innovations, and services, as well as up-to-date cybersecurity.The recent amendments clarify which institutions will be covered by the policy and which institutions are only be encouraged to adopt it. This distinction is absent in the former version.As amended, the Cloud First Policy covers all departments, bureaus, offices, and agencies of the executive branch, government-owned and/or controlled corporations (GOCCs), state universities and colleges (SUCs), local government units (LGUs), and all cloud service providers and private entities rendering services to the government.Meanwhile, the Congress, the Judiciary, the Independent Constitutional Commissions, and the Office of the Ombudsman are encouraged to adopt the Cloud First Policy, the release added.The amendments also clarify the government’s policy on data sovereignty, a concept that was confused with data residency in the previous version.In the latest version of the policy, the application of Philippine laws over its foreign counterparts is asserted over data owned or processed by the Philippine government or any entity that has links to the Philippines.Additional provisions on ICT capacity building and development of essential skills to meet international and local standards are also included.Data classifications are updated to include the following: highly sensitive government, above-sensitive government, sensitive government, and non-sensitive government data.The new classifications provide a more consistent structure to guide the application of safety protocols on the access, storage, processing, and transmission of data in the cloud.The DICT Secretary, Gregorio B. Honasan II, said that the department is continuously updating policies to adapt to the present times.With the amended Cloud First Policy, it is paving the way to an ICT policy environment that is more responsive to current needs, further filling gaps in the country’s digitalisation efforts.The recent amendments to the Cloud First Policy are expected to further enable government agencies to serve the public more efficiently.With concise guidelines, government agencies can now implement cloud-based services that are at par with global standards.DICT-10 has also planned a project to implement free WiFi sites in 353 locations across the country, a The DICT Assistant Regional Director, Frederick D.C. Amores, shared that even before the pandemic, the department was looking to make connectivity available in various institutions.DICT has training programmes for digital marketing and online jobs, among others.In the coming years, the department intends to have a stronger network for government, schools, and SUCs to connect to the internet.Among the key programmes, the DICT is promoting is the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), which will use digital signatures.The Director explained that there are still areas with no internet connection because they are not viable for commercial telecoms to come in while others are beset by armed conflict, making it difficult to install communication facilities.One possible, but expensive, solution is the use of satellites to bring connectivity to those areas with no signal or connection.DICT also proposes a broadband network for the government across the region and Mindanao. It is important to build internal capacity for the government to provide connectivity.",https://opengovasia.com/dict-amends-philippine-cloud-first-policy/,http://opengovasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Article-Samya_June-23.png
Australia must develop a national security cloud			,Article has not blurp,"Australian national security agencies must develop a national security cloud and finally catch up to the private sector in terms of cloud adoption, according to the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI).In a new report, ASPI “For agencies that rely on cutting-edge high technology for their capability edge, this is disastrous,” the report states.Unless this is addressed rapidly and comprehensively, Australia will quite simply be at a major disadvantage against potential adversaries who are using this effective new technology at scale to advance their analysis and operational performance.Australia will also fall further behind its allies, ASPI said, arguing that the US national security community has a lead of at least five years over Australian partner agencies.This change must be driven by ministers and agency heads rather than CIOs and security staff, ASPI said.The report states that this is because security accreditation standards and processes can’t lead technological change. By definition and by design, security standards are lag controls, based on what’s already understood and formed from experience with past and present technical systems.Ministers and agency heads have both the responsibility and perspective to look beyond the important current technical security standards and rules and think about the capability benefit that cloud computing can bring to Australia’s national security.Accordingly, ASPI has called for the government to commit to major investments in cloud infrastructure and services for Australian intelligence agencies as part of any government stimulus to Australia’s digital economy.The intelligence community needs to make this shift as a community, not as a rag-tag band of loosely coordinated agencies with agency heads making separate risk-based decisions, the report adds.This collaboration should involve the development of a national security cloud that has agencies’ interoperability as a core principle, ASPI said.The most powerful cloud infrastructure and applications are useless without the fuel they need to operate — data. So, the maximum data needs to be brought into the national security cloud by each agency in the intelligence community.The report also notes that decisions will be divisive and difficult, but national capability, not agency fiefdoms, needs to be the overriding interest.Another key attribute for the national security cloud must be security. Information hosted on the cloud must be protected from both state and non-state cyber actors who are already targeting Australian government systems.As a result, data must be hosted onshore, and security must go beyond personal and system security to include the resilience and integrity of the supply chains that cloud infrastructure and service providers rely on to produce their products.This is a newly obvious priority exposed by the vulnerabilities seen in global supply chains through the pandemic — and high-technology supply chains are particularly exposed to Chinese state influence unless security is a design principle baked in from the start.ASPI also advised against what it anticipates as a tendency to adopt cloud infrastructure at the lower levels of classification first before more highly classified data.The institute argued that combining valuable top-secret information with the huge trove of lower classification and open-source data is a source of distinctive advantage that agencies can offer the government.“So, failing to incorporate highly classified data holdings with the analytic horsepower and flexibility that cloud infrastructure and applications bring would be a bit like adopting jet propulsion for reconnaissance aircraft during World War II but sticking with piston-engine aircraft for your fighter fleet, even as your enemy chooses otherwise,” the report concludes.",https://opengovasia.com/australia-must-develop-a-national-security-cloud/,http://opengovasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Article_18-June-2020_1-Aus.png
HK government tech lab launches V-OS Cloud Authentication solution			,Article has not blurp,"Despite the havoc that the COVID-19 pandemic is wreaking on firm across the globe, the incubatees at Hong Kong’s Smart Government Innovation Lab have been able to sustain their release of solutions.Recently, another one of its supported firms developed a solution that is now ready to be acquired by other firms, government agencies and academic institutions.Solution descriptionThe The tech follows the procedure of operation detailed below:Application AreasThe solution can be applied in the areas of Broadcasting, City Management, Climate and Weather, Commerce and Industry, Development, Education, Employment and Labour, Environment, Finance, Food, Health, Housing, Infrastructure, Law and Security, Population, Recreation and Culture, Social Welfare as well as Transport.Technologies UsedThe solution employs the latest Mobile Technologies.Use CaseCloud authentication technology One Key verticals like banking and financial, healthcare and manufacturing sectors are witnessing a surge in demand for cloud-based solutions, owing to features like remote data storage capabilities and provisioning of privileges for hosted applications.This crisis has derailed the economy of Asian countries to a certain extent. Governments in these countries, therefore, are encouraging the adoption of advanced digital capabilities amongst small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and large enterprises.For example, the Infocomm Media Development Authority of Singapore (IMDA) has introduced GoCloud to support SMEs when migrating from legacy software development procedures and architectures to cloud-based applications delivered as cloud-native applications or services. This will help businesses to perform effectively during the pandemic, in addition to supporting the economy of the country.Cloud service providers are also witnessing a surge in the adoption of cloud-based communication and collaboration tools through a rise in audio conference calls, video collaboration solutions and virtual schooling.During the pandemic, the majority of organisations are providing a work from home facility to employees in countries such as India, Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong and New Zealand.There is a high demand for software-as-a-service (SaaS) based offerings from enterprises, specifically for teleworking and remote conferencing. Low staff presence to monitor local servers or data centres has compelled them to opt for public cloud offerings.The benefits of cloud services align directly with broader enterprise strategies like new product and services developments, resulting in the creation of new revenue streams and adopt an agile transformation model to align their operations as per changing business requirements.About the Smart Government Innovation LabIn 2018, the Government established the Smart Government Innovation Lab to explore hi-tech products such as AI and relevant technologies, including machine learning, big data analytics, cognitive systems and intelligent agent, as well as blockchain and robotics from firms, especially local start-ups.The Lab is always on the lookout for innovation and technology (I&T) solutions that are conducive to enhancing public services or their operational effectiveness.I&T suppliers are encouraged to regularly visit the Lab’s website to check on the current business and operational needs in public service delivery and propose innovative solutions or product suggestions to address them.",https://opengovasia.com/hk-government-tech-lab-launches-v-os-cloud-authentication-solution/,http://opengovasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Article_10-June-2020_1-HK-1.jpg
WA government and Austmine launch digital mining export hub			,Article has not blurp,"The Western Australian Mines and Petroleum Minister officially launched the inaugural Austmine WA METS Digital Mining Export Hub in Port Hedland on 4 September 2020. The Hub putting Western Australia’s Mining Equipment, Technology and Services sector in the spotlight.The The virtual hub aims to initially provide services in Port Hedland, Karratha, Newman, Kalgoorlie and Bunbury. METS businesses are a vital part of the resource sector supply chain and contributed an estimated $27 billion to the WA economy in 2018-19.The WA Government has committed $350,000 and in-kind support worth $50,000, through Invest and Trade WA, to establish this initiative.  The Mines and Petroleum Minister stated that the launch of Austmine’s WA METS Digital Mining Export Hub is ground-breaking for the local METS sector and a fantastic result for Western Australia.He noted that Western Australia’s mining technology is world-leading, and the hub will enable these local companies to provide their services across the globe. The export hub will not only be vital in supporting the State’s recovery, post-COVID-19 but will also be a boost to jobs and in the state’s local economies.The Pilbara MLA stated that the establishment of the Hub was an exciting announcement for mining, equipment, technology and services companies in the Pilbara region. There’s no better time than now to identify new export opportunities for the sector, and use Western Australia’s digital capability to strengthen our economy.WA is the world’s top mining destinationAccording to The Australian state, which is home to almost 130 export-oriented mining projects and hundreds of smaller quarries and mines producing over 50 different commodities, had ranked second in 2018. In August 2020, the Premier of Western Australia and the Mines and Petroleum Minister The investment, which forms part of the WA Recovery Plan, will boost exploration opportunities and provide next-generation geoscience information for Western Australia’s resources sector. The EIS supports five high-level programs, including the successful co-funded drilling program, which offers up to a 50% refund for innovative drilling in under-explored areas in WA. The additional $5 million will increase funding for the EIS to $15 million in 2020-21, resulting in an extra $3 million which is available across the next two co-funded drilling rounds.The funding will accelerate the acquisition of airborne electromagnetic data from the southern half of the State, which is testing for the presence of critical battery minerals (such as nickel) and water. Curtin University, in Bentley, has a 27-year-old ion microprobe that previously provided valuable data about the timing of mineralising events, but it is no longer fully operational.State funding of $3.2 million will enable Curtin to secure $5 million in Commonwealth funding to purchase a new CAMECA-1300 Ion Microprobe, which will be an Australian first. In addition to its geoscience applications, the instrument will be used to support the Australian Space Agency’s interest in increasing Australian participation in international deep space sample return missions.The Premier noted that the flow-on effect from this additional investment in exploration and technology will result in drilling companies deploying more rigs and workers, and lead to new resource discoveries.”The Mines and Petroleum Minister had said that the new ion microprobe instrument is next-generation, it will be an Australian-first and one of only five in the world. It will revolutionise their understanding of how and when Western Australia’s key mineral deposits formed.The resources industry is already a world-leader in technology and research; having access to the Ion Microprobe will provide the State with a unique technological advantage to discover the next generation of resources. Interestingly, the Ion Microprobe has potential applications well beyond the resources sector, such as understanding the formation of our solar system.",https://opengovasia.com/wa-govt-and-austmine-launch-digital-mining-export-hub/,http://opengovasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Article_4-Sept-2020_3-Aus.jpg
"DOT, DTI empowers Philippine MSMEs through online platforms and webinars			",Article has not blurp,"The goal of the Philippine Harvest e-commerce site of the Department Of Tourism is a contactless farm-to-market experience that promotes local farmers and micro, small and medium enterprises. In this new normal, Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo-Puyat urges the public that it is best to utilise the advancements there is today using the internet by visiting phharvestdot.com.The Philippines is rich in agricultural lands thus the abundant harvests. However, without a proper systematized way of the distribution of the goods, most of them go to waste. In a survey, over 2,000 tons of food are thrown away every single day just in Metro Manila, even though one in three Filipinos lives below the poverty line. This is indeed a global problem not only happening in the country.To prevent food waste, the creation of the said portal was even pushed to materialize. This is a sustainable solution that even the Department of Trade and Industry also believes in as they successfully launched a platform that does just that called “Go Lokal!”.Powered and supported by an IT solutions company, the portal guarantees an easy online shopping and an elevated dining experience in every household as it promises fast and reliable delivery from merchants that deliver the food fresh and clean right onto doorsteps.The platform gives a unique privilege to all partner-merchants. They will gain proper access to business tools available and respective accounts for order tracking, inventory management, product catalogues and links to their social media sites, etc.The aim of “Go Lokal” is to also empower Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises in the country that sells not only fresh produce but other locally manufactured goods. Interested buyers need to visit the site https://www.shopinas.com/go-lokal and are assured a convenient, practical and virus transmission-free transactions.In a recent study, the country’s economy had shrunk due to weaker remittances, prolonged, stringent domestic lockdown and soft foreign demand. Experts see the GDP falling 6.1% this year, which is down 2.2 percentage points from last months forecast. Next year, it is projected to accelerate by 7.5%.The sudden drop of the economy in the Philippines pushes government agencies like DTI and DOT to provide opportunities to MSMEs through substantial webinars and the creation of effective online platforms. The buy local, go local concept revolves around the message for citizens to give preference to the products of Philippine MSMEs at this time of pandemic to contribute to the improvement of the economy.The Senate and House Of Representatives, under the Bayanihan Bill 2, recognises the tourism sector as key in their efforts of ensuring the survival of the 99.9% of 144,640 MSMEs with businesses ranging from accommodation to food services based on the 2018 data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). In a recent statement by DOT, they expressed their gratitude to the Bicameral Conference Committee for approving an allocation of PHP 10 billion (US$ 206 million) for the tourism industry under the Bayanihan To Recover As One or the Bayanihan Bill 2.Meanwhile, the Department of Trade and Industry organised free webinars for MSMEs. In Laguna, they conducted a web-based training on Retail Management in the local “Negosyo” (Business) Centre. The interaction was also aired via Facebook Live to address a wider audience. The free webinar is part of the SME Roving Academy which promotes the continuance of learning among MSMEs to become competitive in domestic and international markets amid the health crisis.",https://opengovasia.com/dot-dti-empowers-philippine-msmes-through-online-platforms-and-webinars/,http://opengovasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4_Sept_2020_2-Ph-Revised-Version.jpg

Vietnam to issue rules on terrestrial mobile communication terminal devices			,Article has not blurp,"The Ministry of Information and Communications (MIC) last week held a webinar to assess the impacts of a draft circular on the According to the representative of the MIC’s Information Technology Department, the building of national technical regulations on terminal devices of terrestrial mobile communication is one of the breakthrough solutions to spur domestic business and manufacturing activities. The draft circular includes the requirement that terminal devices of terrestrial mobile communication must be integrated with 4G.The building of the draft draws on lessons from a range of other countries including Singapore, where terminal device manufacturers and suppliers must ensure their support of IMT-2000 technology, which are 3G and LTE-Advanced (4G).Addressing the event, Phan Tam, the Deputy Minister of Information and Communications, explained that technology changes constantly, especially mobile communication. Globally, some countries have deployed 5G, and Vietnam is among the pioneers. Vietnam, agencies, and businesses related to terminal device manufacturing and trading and mobile operations are not exempt from this trend. The government’s goals for national digital transformation cannot be realised on 2G, he noted.The deputy minister asked agencies and businesses to discuss measures and solutions to accelerate the transformation in a way that minimises impacts on businesses and locals. Currently, the draft circular is available for comments on the MIC portal.The trend of online applications has been blossoming, especially in the COVID-19 landscape. Additionally, the government’s Decision No.749/QD-TTg dated 3 June on the approval of the national digital transformation program by 2025 with a vision to 2030 creates the foundation for digital transformation in digital infrastructure development:At present, Vietnam has six mobile telecommunications service providers with over 129 million subscribers. 2G, 3G, and 4G are available, and 5G will be commercialised soon.Addressing the webinar, some mobile telecommunications service providers recommended that it is time to consider turning off 2G, maybe by 2025. 4G will bring about more values but needs time to develop services. However, the extension of 2G will facilitate businesses and associations of transportation businesses because over one million automobiles are equipped with 2G-based cruise control devices, in addition to many fishing boats.MIC recently announced that the In the White Book, the first section will provide an overview of the ICT development in Vietnam and the world during the year, the message by the MIC Minister, along with the highlights and ranking of the country’s ICT sector in the world.It will also include articles on the importance of the national digital transformation program to national socio-economic development, as well as orientations for IT and telecommunication development.The second section will feature data about the top 20 localities in IT revenue, the number of their IT businesses and workers, and the top 20 IT enterprises in terms of revenue, workforce, and contribution to the state budget.

Digital asset exchanges essential for Malaysia 5.0			,Article has not blurp,"The Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) has been known for its primary task to manage and lead Malaysia’s digital economy forward. As MDEC is positioned to ramp up the Malaysia 5.0, a concept that will work towards and contribute to a more sustainable and circular economy.This will be done via the development of a national-level digital ecosystem with a unified alliance of stakeholders, both from within government and across the private sector that will enable business and societal migration onto the digital age.Malaysia 5.0 directly addresses financial inclusion, access, performance and growth through the Fourth Industrial Revolution (“4IR”) tools, such as fintech, blockchain and artificial intelligence. These digital initiatives and hubs will emerge as core components for next-gen infrastructure of every country. They will be the ones facilitating the interoperability of goods and services that are flowing through them with interconnectivity between various market sectors.Digital asset exchanges will play an important role as they offer participants the ability to monetise their activities over digital infrastructure, essentially serving as the capital markets for Malaysia 5.0.These digital exchanges are, primarily, dynamic asset conversion facilities that will bridge current legacy marketplaces with new e-marketplaces. More importantly, they ensure both platforms can co-exist for the foreseeable future.Challenges that businesses face currently include the inability to deploy capital and move assets seamlessly between legacy platforms. This is a historic problem for exchanges that persisted since their inception as floor-based marketplaces and are still present even after legacy platforms moved over to electronic trading. As legacy systems were still operating as stand-alone pools of liquidity, interoperability between newer and older systems are difficult to manage, expensive and only possible via multiple intermediaries.The advent change for digital exchanges will reduce redundancies in capital markets and even provide enhanced liquidity and transparency. As is, legacy exchanges work well for blue-chip companies, in the same way, banks function as efficient lenders for the larger multi-national corporations. However, for start-ups and small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), these options carry massive costs and overhead expenses.As for the future of exchanges, it will combine digital and traditional assets in ways that can potentially change the decades-old exchange model. The impact of such changes will be dramatic, especially for start-ups and SMEs. Tokenisation and blockchain-based solutions will revolutionise the ability of smaller companies to raise capital as it makes the process more streamlined and cost-effective.For MDEC, as the primary digital change agency, its role focuses on supporting and managing such transformational shifts. The need for robust institutional-grade digital asset exchanges in trusted environments is, now, greater than ever. This trend is already starting to happen in regulated environments as opposed to the ‘Crypto Wild West’.Globally, digital asset exchanges represent a huge opportunity – the Southeast Asia region included. The market for digital assets has evolved substantially as security tokens started to gain more traction with institutional investors.  A survey conducted by the World Economic Forum already predicted how 10% of the world’s GDP will be stored on blockchain technology by 2027. This is an equivalent of US$24 trillion in financial assets.Undoubtedly, Malaysia 5.0 is the golden opportunity to position the country into the heart of Digital ASEAN. The potential for early adopter countries, especially those that are taking the lead, is further facilitated as round-the-clock transactions become easier, cheaper and more secure while expanding its global reach.",https://opengovasia.com/digital-asset-exchanges-essential-for-malaysia-5-0/,http://opengovasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Article_2-Sept-2020_2-Malaysia.jpg
Singapore’s Immigration & Checkpoints Authority is transforming its service delivery			,Article has not blurp,"From 1 September 2020, Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents with registered SingPass accounts will start receiving digital push notifications from the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) on Identity Card (IC) and passport-related matters.These notifications will be sent either to their SingPass Mobile application or as an SMS to the mobile number registered in their SingPass account.Currently, Singapore residents receive hardcopy letters and/or email notifications from ICA on IC and passport-related matters. For example, Singaporeans receive a hardcopy letter nine months before their passport’s expiry, that informs them about the impending expiration of their passport and the process for applying for a new passport.Singaporeans who have successfully applied for their passport also receive hardcopy notification cards to alert them that their passport is ready for collection. Hardcopy letters are also sent to Singapore residents two weeks before their 30th or 55th birthday, to remind them to re-register their IC.Singapore residents can also login to MyICA (www.ica.gov.sg) to access IC and passport notifications and check on the status of related transactions.New Digital Push Notification ServiceICA has partnered GovTech to launch a new digital service to push notifications on IC and passport-related matters to Singapore residents with registered SingPass accounts.These notifications will be sent via their SingPass Mobile application for those who have downloaded it or as an SMS to the mobile number registered in their SingPass account. As such, Singapore residents should ensure that their contact details in SingPass are updated, to be able to receive these digital push notifications.Upon receiving the digital push notifications, Singapore residents can click on the link within to be directed to the ICA website to begin their transactions or check on the outcome of their applications.Singapore residents who do not have a SingPass account will continue to receive hardcopy letters or emails if they have registered an email address with ICA.More digital push notification services for ICA’s other products and services will be progressively rolled out.

HKBU rolls out COVID-19 alert system			,Article has not blurp,"Researchers from Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) have developed a COVID-19 alert system that will send a message to users through a mobile app if they and an infected person have visited the same place within a period that gives rise to risks of exposure.The system will not collect users’ personal information and location data, thereby protecting individuals’ privacy while alerting them on disease transmission risks associated with confirmed infection cases.HKBU plans to launch a trial run of the system on campus in the new semester to enhance COVID-19 risks alert capability inside campus venues and during teaching and learning activities. Staff and students can join the trial voluntarily.Developed by a research team led by the Associate Head and Professor of the Department of Computer Science at HKBU, By taking a decentralised design approach, the system, which has been developed in four months, will not collect any personal information and location data. It is a safe and reliable system that uses the latest cryptographic technology to protect users’ privacy. It also includes a mechanism that prevents users from falsely claiming that they are one of the contacts of a confirmed case.Under the venue-to-person tracing mode, when users scan the QR code before entering the venue, the venue information and the time of visit will be saved onto their mobiles. If a user tests positive for the virus, he will receive a password to log on to the system, which will then broadcast the information, including the venues he has visited and the visiting times in the past 14 days, to all users’ mobiles.The system will send an alert to the users through their mobile phones if they and the infected user have visited the same place in the same period in the past two weeks. This will enable users to take appropriate action, including virus tests.The person-to-person tracing mode is supported by Bluetooth Low Energy, a wireless communication technology. If two users stay within two meters of each other for a certain period, their mobile phones will exchange an anonymous code via Bluetooth and then save it in the respective phone’s database. The anonymous code associated with each user’s mobile phone will change regularly.If a user tests positive for the virus, the other users’ mobile phones will receive the codes broadcast by the infected user’s mobile phone over the past two weeks. By comparing the codes in the database of the mobile phone, the system can assess the risk for each user that came into contact with the infected person, and set off the alarm if necessary.Users’ privacy is well protected because all the information is stored on an individual’s mobile phone. HKBU plans to launch a trial run of the venue-to-person tracing mode of the alert system on campus. The experience of launching the system, including the lessons learned throughout the technological development process and in terms of encouraging members of the University and visitors to use the system, will help the Government and relevant organisations combat the pandemic.The Vice-President (Research and Development) of HKBU stated since the early stages of the pandemic, HKBU has been boosting various research projects related to the virus research projects and the development of this alert system is one of the results.The system can effectively warn people who have been in contact with a confirmed case, but it does not collect personal information. It strikes a balance between disease prevention and privacy protection.As the global pandemic is not yet at its end, the team will make efforts to collaborate with the Government and the relevant departments to help society by transferring the University’s research and contributing to the fight against the pandemic in Hong Kong.CEM tech is a mustThe COVID-19 pandemic has drawn attention to the urgent need for better crisis management technologies. According to Everbridge, an effective Critical Event Management program and strategy is an integrated, end-to-end process that enables organisations to significantly speed up responses to critical events and improve outcomes by mitigating or eliminating the impact of a threat.This CEM system would mean that business continuity, disaster recovery, active assailant, emergency response, natural disaster, IT incident risk management, and mass notification would all be rolled up into an easy-to-execute, strategic plan with long-term benefits.In May 2020, Everbridge hosted Coronavirus: the Road to Recovery on May 20The event gathered nearly 20 executive speakers from major multinational organisations.

The key to that is empowering and educating our employees and to find the right partners.He also cautioned the delegates to not try and do everything in-house as it will cost more money and time. Since both are of the essence in the current scenario, a wise decision would be to collaborate with experts in the field.Mohit encouraged the delegates to create alliances with those who are already thinking ahead of time in the cybersecurity industry and can help organisations thrive in these times with suitable solutions.After Mohit, Genie Gan, Head of Public Affairs and Government relations APAC, Kaspersky came forward to share her insights. She began by stressing the crucial role that governments play in times of crises.Furthering the points highlighted by Mohit, Genie shared her observations of how the bad actors are capitalising on the chaos.She shared interesting facts about the security threat landscape in Indonesia during the last one year. Her data showed that there were more than 220 million cyber-attack attempts in Indonesia according to the National Cyber and encryption agency.Keeping in mind the state of affairs in the Indonesian cybersecurity landscape, Genie emphasised that digital defence is as critical as digital innovation for any government that is aiming to digitally transform the nation.She concluded by sharing a four-pronged approach to addressing cyber threats and validated each point with an example/ success story from the APAC region:After Genie, Dr Aswami Ariffin, SVP & Cyber Forensics Scientist, Cyber Security Response Services at Cyber Security Malaysia shared his learnings on the topic. He explained that with the new tech and applications being introduced, they have observed a heightened cyber risk through their threat intelligence. He also shared some current data that showed an overall rise in malware infections and that the botnet drone-count has gone up throughout 2019.Aswami further shared that as a national organisation they not only engage with both the public and the private sector to help establish a robust cyber defence system.The robust cyber defence system is backed up by a well-structured 6 step process that involves detection, preservation, eradication, forensics analysis, presentation and finally the takedown.He really highlighted the importance of collecting intelligence by analysing the three important factors in running a business: people, process and technology.Aswami urged the audience organisations to not just intake intelligence from outside parties but also set up their internal sensors and monitoring mechanisms. He gave the mantra of He concluded his presentation by emphasising the need for coordinated effort and strong information-sharing networks amongst organisations.After the informative presentation, the session got more interactive by way of polling questions for the audience.On the first question about their organisation’s biggest cybersecurity concern, the audience was almost equally divided among all four options given to them (25% for each).One of our delegates from a public sector agency reflected that they have carefully monitored the nature of cyber-attacks over the last two years. They found out that most of them come from targeted attacks by hackers outside the organisation, making them a bigger threat.On the next question regarding primary IT security spending the delegates again seemed equally divided among all four available options.Another senior IT executive from the audience shared that they voted for endpoint security as, in their experience, it is the most reliable and feasible strategy, especially in his organisation as everyone uses their own device and is responsible for it.On the final question about proactively planning to prevent cybersecurity attacks in future, a major chunk of delegates voted for deploying threat intelligence (36%).When asked the reason for choosing this specific option, one of the delegates shared that investing in threat intelligence if the best way to prevent cybersecurity attacks as it gives you updates about the latest cyber threats around us.

India ramps up internet connectivity for villages post critical event – cyclone Nisarga			,Article has not blurp,"Cyclone Nisarga hit the Indian state Maharashtra in June. Parts of the West coast including, Mumbai, Raigad, Thane, and Palghar, were at high risk. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) termed the cyclone as a severe and dangerous one. Apart from the damage to life and livelihood, the cyclone disrupted daily life, including education.After the cyclone hit, about 200 children had to travel 50 kilometers to reach an area with an internet connection to attend online classes from their remote coastal villages. According to a A student reached out to the National Commission for Protection Child Rights (NCPCR) for help. The agency ensured that the connectivity would be restored in the fastest possible manner by reaching out to cellular companies and the district magistrate of the area. In July, the NCPCR Chairman said that the commission told the district magistrate of Ratnagiri to immediately intervene in the matter, make the liaison, and issue suitable directions to the concerned cellular service provider to get the internet connectivity restored at the earliest. No child should be a victim of undue pressure or stress concerning their education, he stated.The chairman said the NCPCR continuously followed up with the authorities, and the internet connection in the area was eventually restored by one of the cellular networks. The rest of them assured that they will resolve the issue at the earliest. The organisation intervened and wrote to the district magistrate and cellular companies and dealt with it as a policy intervention.As a result, the action was taken on a priority basis and internet connectivity in the village was restored. He also noted that it is very important to ensure efficient internet facilities for the children in these times. If children are dependent upon the internet for their education, then it needs to be ensured that they get a barrier-free internet facility.Meanwhile, several The app showcased weather data (maximum and minimum temperatures, rainfall figures, relative humidity, and wind speed for all the major locations in Mumbai city. Along with the live and real-time weather and rainfall information, the app provides hourly weather and rainfall forecasts up to 24 hours in advance, helping residents to plan their day. The Mumbai Rain data is fetched directly from Skymet Weather’s Automatic Weather Stations (AWS). Another unique feature of the app is that it helps the user with real-time traffic and with live rainfall information over one map.The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) website also helped victims track the cyclone. Users could visit the IMD website, go to the ‘Our Services’ section by scrolling down, select the cyclone option, and select the ‘Track of cyclonic disturbances’ option in the left corner of the website.IMD also monitored the cyclone with the help of available satellite observations from Various numerical weather prediction models run by the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) institutions, global models, and dynamical-statistical models were utilised to predict the genesis, landfall, and intensity of the cyclone. IMD used a digitised forecasting system for the analysis and comparison of the various model guidance, decision-making processes, and warning product-generation.Not only forecasting but timely warning can also prevent disruption of life and property when natural disasters like these hit.

IoT and AI can help improve responsiveness to current and future Critical Events			,Article has not blurp,"In coping with the current crisis, the need for accurate and actionable information is paramount for an effective response – but there has never before been a scenario like the current COVID-19 pandemic. In case of a critical event, whether it is an active shooter, natural disaster or pandemic, access to information is vital.One crucial lesson that emergency responders have learned from simulations is that information is often too fragmented to provide actionable intelligence: the larger the incident, the more complicated it is to collect and assess information and coordinate a response.There are, however, many tools available to tame this complexity for more rapid and effective response and to minimise impact on responders. These generally address four stages of response management.In the first, they gather data from various sources to help assess the context and severity of a critical event, calling upon analytical tools to digest and correlate data to help response teams understand what is happening now and what could or will happen later. A second stage locates assets, employees or vital equipment. In a third stage, these systems offer emergency responders and organisations the tools to act by informing people of actions to take, mass-scale notifications for people in affected areas and tools for collaboration between response teams. The final stage enables responders and others concerned to review and evaluate the critical event so that future response can be improved.Incident response management platforms are often homegrown among responsible agencies and organisations, but technology providers exist to support efforts. Some of these technologies consolidate functionality for all four stages into a single system. As reportedIn smart buildings and smart cities, sensors can provide details about temperature, toxic gases and other hazardous conditions. Smart streetlights can analyse traffic congestion and plan evacuation routes through AI analytics. Body cameras can relay live intelligence from public safety workers to the Incident Command Center (ICS), while crisis teams can use IoT wearables to warn and guide civilians.Artificial intelligence technologyThe Chinese search engine Baidu has made its Linearfold algorithm available to researchers and medical teams to fight the outbreak to assist in the analysis of the virus, while across the world researchers are turning to AI technology to predict its spread.Even when everybody understands that it is vital to track data on people’s condition and location during the current times, but it has a definite The privacy issues are relevant to technology providers, which also see a growing trend among companies that want to know which employee is in which location. In the case of the COVID-19 outbreak, employers may want to see which employee has been in close proximity to a person who has tested positive for the virus.However, technology’s role in containing and mitigating the virus in the absence of a rapid and reliable diagnostic tool cannot be undermined. It lets governments respond and recover from the global pandemic which would have been a more herculean task than it already is.Technology providers who are seeking to improve response, stewardship of sensitive data and transparency of processes moving forward must understand that establishing trust and confidence amongst people is of paramount importance.",https://opengovasia.com/iot-and-ai-can-help-improve-responsiveness-to-current-and-future-critical-events/,http://opengovasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CEM-Image.jpg
Malaysia and Japan leverage CEM technology to fight COVID-19			,Article has not blurp,"Japan and Malaysia have been closely collaborating to contain the spread of Covid-19, the Japan ambassador to Malaysia A Lieutenant Colonel at the Malaysia Civil Defence Force, who has led efforts in developing anti-COVID-19 standard operating procedures, as well as setting up and managing quarantine stations, is a graduate of MJIIT’s Master of Disaster Risk Management programme.MJIIT is the culmination of long-lasting bilateral cooperation under the Look East Policy, which was launched in 1981. The significance of Japanese developmental cooperation lies in the prioritisation of human resource development. For instance, there are nine Japanese professors teaching at MJIIT, sharing state-of-the-art Japanese engineering expertise.Under the Look East Policy, more than 17,000 Malaysians studied in Japan and they are now playing leading roles in Malaysia. Their presence gives a unique strength to the friendship between Japan and Malaysia. The 40At its launch, Malaysia’s Prime Minister stated that no one should be left behind from vaccines. Japan shares his aspirations and looks forward to furthering cooperation with Malaysia in international fora. The ambassador stated that digital technologies such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things would be the key to this transformation. He foresees further engagements of Japan, as a frontrunner in science and technology, in Malaysia in the post-COVID-19 period.In August 2019, the Selangor State Government, a group of researchers from the Disaster Preparedness and Prevention Center (DPPC) of the Malaysia-Japan International Institute of Technology (MJIIT), Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM), International Research Institute of Disaster Science (IRIDeS), Tohoku University, City of Sendai, Japan and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) Replete with simplified technical explanations and illustrations, the Report, called “Disaster Risk Report: Understanding Landslide and Flood Risks for Science-Based Disaster Risk Reduction in the State of Selangor”,  shows how the outputs of science-based analysis such as hazard maps can serve as a decision-making tool that allows local governments and community members better understand their disaster risks and come up with their own preventive actions.This report is the first output of a four-year program run by Selangor State, IRIDeS and DPPC/MJIIT called “Strengthening the Disaster Risk Reduction Capacity to Improve the Safety and Security of Communities by Understanding Disaster Risks (SeDAR)”.The SeDAR program enables the sharing and transferring of knowledge, know-how, and expertise of IRIDeS based on Japanese experience to local community leaders and residents in Malaysia to better prepare for and cope with disasters. DPPC brings technological expertise and local knowledge of the project, while Selangor Disaster Management Unit carries out the outreach activities to bring this knowledge and understanding to the people of Selangor.Pushing CE technologyThe COVID-19 pandemic has drawn attention to the urgent need for better ways of handling crises particularly through the use of technology. This is where Critical Event Management comes in. According to Everbridge, the global leader in critical event management and enterprise safety applications, a critical event is a disruptive incident which poses serious risk or threat to assets or people.An effective Critical Event Management program and strategy is an integrated, end-to-end process that enables organisations to significantly speed up responses to critical events and improve outcomes by mitigating or eliminating the impact of a threat.An effective CEM system would mean that business continuity, disaster recovery, active assailant, emergency response, natural disaster, IT incident risk management, and mass notification would all be rolled up into an easy-to-execute, strategic plan with long-term benefits.",https://opengovasia.com/malaysia-and-japan-leverage-cem-technology-to-fight-covid-19/,http://opengovasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Article_21-Aug-2020_CEM-Malaysia.jpg

This is a huge number, which impacts not only the police who are responsible for finding them, but also the many people who are affected and devastated by the uncertainty and helplessness of having loved ones missing,” she said.The 2020 hackathon will be scaled to maximise the chances of finding crucial pieces of data. Each registered participant will be provided with free self-paced foundational training modules for OSINT, specifically developed for the Australian OSINT environment.During October, a webinar series will be delivered by AustCyber featuring OSINT and cybersecurity experts from Australia and the USA. The live-stream on 29 October will provide enhanced user experience for the day, including presentations, mentoring sessions and a live leader board. A new website will also be deployed to provide information to participants and serve as an ongoing resource for the broader community.Many major organisations, firms and banks have returned as sponsors for 2020, with OSINT Combine joining as a new sponsor. The founder and CEO of OSINT Combine said that OSINT is derived from publicly available information or open-source information.Using public resources and people in a group setting for a ‘collection activity’ allows the analysts and investigators to spend more time on the critical part of connecting the dots and understanding the picture,” he said.The concept of this crowdsourced platform originates from the not-for-profit organisation which has provided its CTF model throughout Canada and the United States, with monthly virtual events known as ‘Global OSINT Search Party CTFs’ that allow participation from around the world.The organisation operates in many locations around the world, working with multiple law enforcement agencies.

"Current cybersecurity landscape demands a robust, intelligence-driven Security Operations Centre			",Article has not blurp,"After engaging in rich discussions on the need to have more robust, technology-driven cybersecurity systems with delegates from the healthcare and public sector industry, OpenGov Asia set out to get the telecom industry’s take on it.On 26 August 2020, OpenGov Asia hosted an OpenGovLive! Virtual Breakfast Insight to discuss the relevance of a Security Operations Centre from the perspective of the telecom industry across ASEAN.The session, To set the tone for the discussions, Mohit Sagar, Group Managing Director and Editor-in-Chief, OpenGov Asia opened the session by highlighting the unpreparedness of individuals and organisations when the pandemic hit the world.The magnitude of the strike was beyond what anyone or any organisation could have imagined; it has made the world push boundaries in everything that was done and that needed to be done.In the midst of this global disaster, bad cyber actors are becoming increasingly sophisticated – making it inevitable for organisations to ensure their cybersecurity systems are robust and up to date with the latest technology.Mohit advised delegates to not just respond to the pandemic and recover from it but also plan to thrive during these testing times. The key to this is empowering and educating employees and finding the right partners to guide organisations on their cybersecurity strategy.Alliances must be forged with those who are already thinking ahead in the cybersecurity landscape and who can help the industry thrive through these times with suitable solutions.After Mohit set the stage for the discussions, Vitaly Kamluk, Director, Global Research and Analytics team, APAC, Kaspersky shared his expertise on the topic.Vitaly began by highlighting the significant rise in the type and frequency of cyber threats this year as a result of the new norm of remote working.Being an expert in the field and having been observing the cyberattacks throughout the year, Vitaly shared some interesting facts and findings.Over the last few months, bad actors in cyberspace have been more focused on creating sophisticated targeted strikes rather than mass threats and attacks.A major reason for this is it helps them get more ransom money without unnecessary (wide) exposure. He substantiated his reasoning by citing data of malware attack trends in 2020.He also shared some recent cases of targeted attacks and the possible actors behind them in the telecom industry in Thailand and Hong Kong. It was eye-opening to note the kind of techniques the attackers have access to – emphasising the need to be secure even more urgent.Vitaly concluded by pointing out another kind of targeted attacks that have become prevalent in the last few months: Ransomware.Big companies have been compromised and blackmailed by these kinds of attacks that involve a three-stage process: 1) Infiltrate and Steal 2) Encrypt and Extort 3) Publish and Shame.He urged the delegates to be vigilant about these threats and report any such instances rather than keeping it to themselves.After Vitaly’s informative presentation, Mohd. Nazri Bin Zawawi, Head Strategy & Governance, Group Information Security, Telekom Malaysia shared his keen insights on the subject at hand.Nazri began by sharing his organisation’s mission, which is to make lives and businesses easier, for a better nation. He spoke with the delegates about his organisation’s experience on their journey and motivation for venturing into an intel-driven SOC.He explained the various drivers that lead them to venture on this journey:In the same vein, he also shared how the implementation of the Intel-driven SOC played out over the years for his organisation.  During the implementation process, they had to overcome a number of challenges like high investment cost, resource crunch, changing priorities, data integrity issues, etc.In conclusion, he advised the delegates to plan for all these challenges well in advance to be able to overcome them quickly and effectively.After the enlightening presentation by the speakers, it was time for the interactive polling session to engage the virtual audience.On the first question about the primary cybersecurity concern of your organisation, a majority of the delegates voted for targeted attacks (46%).The head of cyber defense from a major telecom company in Malaysia shared that he thought targeted attacks are the biggest threat right now because ransomware or any other kind of threat mentioned in the question do not happen without infiltration or a breach. Once the infiltration or the breach happens, it becomes a major concern as it can pave way for many other kinds of threats as well.On the next question about primary IT spending in your organisation, half of the audience voted for SOC technologies (SIEM, Threat Intelligence, SOAR) (50%).On this, a Chief Information Security Officer from a telco company in the Philippines reflected that he voted for SOC technologies based on numbers and not on importance. He believes that all the given options should be high in priority and require investment, but the biggest chunk goes into SOC technologies. That is because the SOC comprises of not just one or two technologies but various distinct technologies.On the final question of planning to proactively prevent cybersecurity attacks, the delegates were equally split between deploy threat intelligence (44%) and engage security assessment services (44%).A senior executive from a telecom company in the Philippines reflected that they actually have a mixed system of getting feeds from a third party along with an internal team to do the intel within the organisation. Thus, they follow a more hybrid system.After the polling session, Victor Chu, Head of Systems Engineering SEA- Enterprise Cybersecurity at Kaspersky addressed the delegates with closing remarks.Victor began by throwing light on what the current threat landscape is looking like. He explained that commodity threat, advanced threat and targeted threats are all on a rise. He then went on to explain what threat intelligence is and why it is important in today’s time.Victor concluded by letting them know that Kaspersky was always willing to partner with them for their cybersecurity needs.

Vietnam government issues spam prevention measures			,Article has not blurp,"The government has issued a The Authority of Information Security under the Ministry of Information and Communications (MIC) is responsible for building and operating a system that collects spam complaints. Advertisers shall have to send a copy of each text message to the system once they send out to prospective customers. Users can complain by forwarding spam messages to the systems.Firms providing Internet and telecommunication services shall have to comply with the MIC’s requirements on the prevention and handling of spam. The decree shall come into effect from 1 October.Businesses in the fields of real estate, insurance, and education will bear the biggest influences from the newly released decree on preventing spam messages and calls. Mobile network operators have blocked spam messages with solutions using AI. Previously, mobile subscribers complained that they received tens of spam messages. But now they only receive several messages a week which invite them to use services.However, after escaping spam messages, mobile phone subscribers have been bothered with spam calls. They receive many calls from the telesales staff at 9-10 am and 2 pm, which invite them to take life insurance policies, borrow money, buy real estate products, and register for English classes.According to the deputy director of the MIC’s Department of Information Security, the decree for the first time defines a spam call. This is a call for advertisement purposes made without the prior consent of the recipients, or calls for advertisement purpose with prohibited content, violating regulations.If mobile phone subscribers refuse advertisement calls, advertisers must stop immediately. The regulations not only protect subscribers from spam calls but also create favorable conditions for businesses and organisations to make advertisement calls legally.According to the chair of the Telecommunication Digital Content Club, in the past, digital content firms sent messages themselves to invite subscribers to use services. However, in the last 2-3 years, they have had to do this through mobile network operators’ SMS systems. Mobile network operators only send messages to subscribers who accept advertisement messages. Therefore, the firms will bear little influence from the new decree.He believes that if the decree is strictly observed, the businesses in the fields of real estate, insurance, and fintech will be affected the most. A new business model may arise, under which sale promotion programs would be organised to encourage clients to register to receive ad messages.However, in the past, mobile network operators once donated data, money, and service fees to subscribers who accept ad messages, but only 30% of clients accepted the messages. A representative of a company that provides telesales platforms admitted that his company would be affected by the decree. However, he said the company anticipates the situation as similar policies are also applied in some countries, including the US.Meanwhile, a representative of a real estate firm in Quang Ninh said the firm sells products through trading floors, not directly. The trading floors will contact clients via calls. The new decree will affect the floors and the company will have to find other sales methods.",https://opengovasia.com/vietnam-government-issues-spam-prevention-measures/,http://opengovasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Article-Samaya_August-26-2.jpg
Intelligent Automation can revolutionise the workings of public sector organisations			,Article has not blurp,"The pandemic has taught the world a lesson – a global crisis can hit anytime and it is critical to be prepared for it.One sector that is most severely impacted by large-scale crises – like the current pandemic – is the public services sector. Rather than scaling down, public services (especially some departments) work more than usual to ensure all basic amenities are available to the citizens as they were instructed to stay at homes.In times like these, where certain public sector departments were working incessantly to help citizens, automation can augment the government’s ability to serve people.In light of its relevance in these times, OpenGov Asia hosted OpenGovLive! Virtual Breakfast Insight with delegates from various public sector agencies from Singapore to discuss and encourage the adoption of automation technologies.The unattended virtual worker is the future of automationThe session opened with a presentation from Mohit Sagar, Group Managing Director and Editor-in-Chief, OpenGov Asia.Mohit began by highlighting the fact that COVID-19 dismantled the status quo in governments and organisations.With all the world going into sudden lockdown, governments had to take the responsibility to provide better and seamless services for citizens and businesses to survive.This was where Digital transformation and implementation of Robotic Process Automation helped ease the pressure in government departments/agencies that were over-burdened.Robotic Process Automation (RPA) not only helps lighten the load by taking over complex repetitive tasks but also helps cut costs – a constant challenge for governments as they continue their battle against COVID-19.Mohit also gave the attendees a glimpse into what the future would look like for automation technology. He opined that the unattended virtual worker who runs on a pre-decided schedule will become the norm.From a long-term perspective, unsupervised robots tend to become more efficient, with lower costs for deploying new ones, scaling up or maintenance. This is mainly due to the higher-utilisation rate of robots and the convenience of adopting the same technology to a different use case in different organisation. The centralisation aspect during execution also ensures that risk aspects around confidentiality and data are managed better.Mohit concluded his presentation by advising organisations to collaborate with experts as they embark upon their journey towards automation rather than trying to do everything on their own.RPA has moved from the realm of mundane to the realm of innovationAfter Mohit’s presentation, Dan Ternes, Chief Technology Officer, Blue Prism, shared his insights on the topic.Dan began by clarifying that RPA today has moved way forward from how we understood it traditionally to a more exciting and comprehensive phase. The way businesses and organisations are using RPA today is in the realm of innovation and no longer merely to do repetitive tasks. Dan explained that traditionally RPA is thought of as something that would boost operational excellence, but now it has away from the spectrum of the menial and the mundane.Organisations are now focusing on automating tasks that are complex, strategic and mission-critical to them. He shared how the public health sector in Singapore used a Blue Prism solution to manage complex data on public health during the pandemic.This journey is now going into the second wave of RPA implementation which involves using it in conjunction with other technologies like Optical Character Recognition, chatbox, natural language processing, etc.He called this the wave of digital simplification. He revealed that a national taxation agency is successfully implementing this in combination with other complementary technologies for automatic compliance checks on deductions.After this, he felt, comes a third wave that breaks away from the constraints of the past. This wave includes initiatives like smart nation and smart cities. He was quick to point out that it is also important to make sure that the new, the digital and the sophisticated must continue to tie into the legacy applications that run our society. Otherwise, the whole system could become get very disintegrated.Dan concluded by sharing that Blue Prism has had a great record of adding value in all three waves and encouraged the delegates to lean towards automation.Various use cases of automation in the field of EducationAfter an enlightening introduction by Dan, Peter Buckmaster, Director of Digital Experience Design at The NSW Department of Education shared his knowledge with the delegates.Peter began by introducing the NSW Department of Education which is the largest education department in the southern hemisphere and shared how it is using automation in its functioning.  He explained that they are using a combination of RPA and AI to enhance their work efficiency and accuracy.The first major bit of automation initiated by the department was automating the process of employee onboarding/access management and the digitising of paperwork involved in the process. This resulted in saving almost 460 hours of work that was done by the department workforce.He listed the 6 broad uses of AI and RPA in the field of education.Peter also played the audience a video featuring examples of how the above-mentioned use cases come into play. The video greatly helped delegates visualise how incorporating automation can enable work efficiency without requiring more time.After Peter’s presentation, it was time to go into a time of polling and engage in discussions around the topic.On the first question about how automation fits into your organisation’s digital transformation journey, almost half the room voted for: Improve work efficiency (53%).Some really interesting perspectives came out of the discussion on this question. A Chief Medical Informatics Officer from a major hospital in Singapore reflected that he chose the above option because, in large organisations like his own, a lot of processes are still undertaken manually by staff. This leads to monotony and impedes workflow efficiency. By automating these processes, high-value work can be allocated to the employees.On the next question regarding the biggest challenge in implementing your digital strategy, the audience was split between Inflexible business processes and teams (37%) and Lack of properly skilled teams (37%).A senior governance officer from an educational institution shared that she chose the former because they feel the need to automate or update some of their existing technology, but always get a lot of resistance from the employees. So there is a need to change people’s mindsets and make them more accepting of technology.On the final question about the biggest area of priority for incorporating automation, the audience was divided between Citizen Engagement (26%) and Co-agency collaboration (26%).On this one, a Chief Digital Officer from another health care institution in Singapore reflected that they are looking to first begin with automating the more manual tasks and then gradually diversify into other more complex and specific tasks.After this fruitful discussion, Mohit invited Dan to bring the session to a conclusion with closing remarks.Dan thanked all the delegates and speakers for participating and contributing to the session. He re-emphasised the fact that automation has great potential and can help solve some of the problems of the “new normal”. He also felt that, apart from having the right technology, it is equally important to have the right vision and implementation process to achieve the desired goals.The delegates left the virtual insight well informed and empowered.",https://opengovasia.com/various-use-cases-of-automation-in-the-field-of-education/,http://opengovasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Group-pic-Sept.-3rd.jpg

KHub revolutionises learning among DOST-Philippine science high school students			,Article has not blurp,"A new version of educational technology for Learning Management Systems (LMS) has Campus KHub is one of its features that enable teachers to meet with their students virtually where subjects and courses are only exclusive to individuals enrolled in it. Another one is the “badges” that rewards students for their aptitude to learning. “Badges” are synonymous to a computer gaming experience as it grants you to unlock levels as you study and answer along.Logging in to KHub gives easy access to teachers in choosing their respective subject matter. Activities related to their lessons are also conveniently provided. They liken the user-friendly portal to a traditional classroom as they ease through submitting examinations and other records to students so they can access and answer them in a timely manner at home.Retakes for examinations are inevitable and sometimes lead to exhaustion among teachers and students alike as the preparation can often be time-consuming; but with the existence of KHub, the said experience pledges to be hassle-free since it serves as a learning and teaching repository.The Research and Policy Academic Division of DOST-PSHSS develops guides in conducting webinars that enhance competence in accessing the portal as it continues to expand the frontier in learning. Institutions are encouraged to undertake these in innovative ways to encourage a culture of learning. The ultimate aim is to drive progress amid the current situation where teachers, staff and students are confined to their homes. This has driven DOST-PSHSS to design and roll out a system that does just that.Naysayers may conclude that it is identical to other existing online learning platforms like Edmodo, Gooru, Nearpod and the like that are also recommended by the Department of Education (DepEd) in terms of a medium for teachers affiliated outside of the DOST-PSHSS to conduct distance learning. This is partially true; however, it has proven to be unique in its own way as it is tailor-fitted to the needs of a specific demographic that it caters to.A non-graded bridging program has also been developed for Philippine Science scholars to guarantee the effectiveness of distance learning with the sole purpose of filling the gap of learning materials removed from the curriculum due to the suspension of classes during the fourth semester of the previous year.DOST has gone a step further in fulfilling its mission of creating a better and brighter society through its adaptability to advancements – introducing a vision of tomorrow that is receptive to the demands of the global market.

The AMA said a March 2021 deadline would align with the end date for JobKeeper wage subsidies.Labor supports the push, with opposition health spokesman stating that telehealth has reduced coronavirus risks for patients and health workers.The extension should include both telephone and videoconference items to maintain access and choice for patients and providers, including those who can’t access video services.And the extension period must be used to agree on a long-term future for telehealth as part of broader efforts to boost the quality and coordination of care.Patients can access telehealth services through Medicare if they are a regular patient of a GP or medical practice, or have been an active patient within the past year.Marie Stopes Australia and the Australasian Society for HIV, Viral Hepatitis and Sexual Health Medicine say there should be an exception for sexual and reproductive healthcare. Without that, the groups say it’s harder for Australians to access medical termination of pregnancy and HIV prevention.",https://opengovasia.com/improving-rehabilitation-technologies-for-remote-healthcare/,http://opengovasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Webp.net-resizeimage-64.jpg
Government Technology Agency Awards Tender for Further Batches of TraceTogether Tokens			,Article has not blurp,"The Government Technology Agency has awarded the tender to design and manufacture further batches of the TraceTogether Tokens to two bidders – a consortium comprising Siix Singapore Pte Ltd and iWOW Pte Ltd; and PCI Private Limited.Design and Production of TraceTogether TokenDrawing from the experience gained in producing the initial batch, GovTech will work with both tenderers to review their designs to further reduce cost, while ensuring effectiveness of the Token for contact tracing. Each Token is expected to cost about $10. GovTech will manage and pace the production of further batches based on demand.Token introduced to enhance TraceTogether Programme The TraceTogether Token will ensure better coverage for everyone in Singapore for effective contact tracing. The token will function in the same way the TraceTogether app does and uses Bluetooth signals to record other nearby TraceTogether devices.TraceTogether Token has no GPS. This means the device does not capture geolocation data and captures only proximity data. This means a person cannot be tracked and nobody would know where a person has been.The device has no Internet or cellular connectivity. This means the data cannot be pulled from the device unless the user physically hands in the device to MOH contact tracers, if they are confirmed to be infected with COVID-19.If the user becomes a patient, it is critical that close contacts are identified as soon as possible. This is when MOH will ask the user to hand over his device for the data to be extracted, for contact tracing. If users are not identified to the COVID positive, the encrypted proximity data will reside in the device for 25 days and then be deleted on a rolling basis.Without using digital contact tools, contact tracing is slow, taxing and not very reliable since as human memory is not always accurate and cannot remember everyone and every place they have encountered in a two week period. Rapid contact tracing will help reduce these risks.The Singapore Government has introduced a range digital tools and solutions including TraceTogether and SafeEntry to supplement contact tracing efforts by the Ministry of Health during the pandemic. How the Token WorksMr Chan Cheow Hoe, the Government Chief Digital Technology Officer and GovTech deputy chief executive, explained that the Trace Together Token is designed to do only one thing: capture proximity data based on Bluetooth signals.Every five minutes, it scans to detect other TraceTogether users on the Token or the app. The more ‘hits’ between two TraceTogether users, the more likely the two users are in close proximity for an extended period of time. Proximity can be estimated by the strength of the Bluetooth signal.The closer users are to one another, the stronger the signal is and vice versa. According to Mr Chan, the Token’s battery allows it to continuously scan for between six to nine months, with no charging required.Data Used For TraceTogether TokenThere are only four types of data contained in the token: the Bluetooth signal, the user’s randomised ID, the randomised ID of any other user in proximity and a timestamp of the encounter.The IDs do not refer to a NRIC number, but randomised and anonymised IDs linked to a personal identifier like a mobile number. No data is extracted unless a user has tested positive for COVID-19. “From there, the MOH has a special software key that can unlock the device and reveal the data for use in contact tracing,",https://opengovasia.com/government-technology-agency-awards-tender-for-further-batches-of-tracetogether-tokens/,http://opengovasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TT-Vivek-2.jpg

That’s why we’re providing tailored resources to help parents and carers support their children – and themselves.The child psychologist, Dr Michael Carr-Gregg, stated, “coronavirus has turned the lives of many Victorian families upside down, asking them yet again to navigate a new reality of remote learning, working from home and for some, financial hardship. Never has it been more important to provide families with simple, practical and evidence-based strategies to help them maintain the family’s wellbeing and build resilience, he added.The Executive Director of the Raising Children Network noted that all parents need support to help their children thrive, and podcasts are great ways to deliver engaging, reliable and credible information on topics that are on parents’ minds. Raising Learners will focus on how parents can support their children’s learning at school, and home.Pushing online and blended learningUniversities in Australia and New Zealand have been investing in digital learning for some time.

HKBU launches online counselling programme			,Article has not blurp,"A research team led by the Department of Social Work at Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) has The programme is recruiting 280 tertiary students with the aim of providing easy access to counselling services, and it hopes to help students alleviate distress when encountering challenges in post-secondary school life.REST Online to enhance stress management skillsTertiary students experience stress arising from changes in lifestyle, increased workload and new interpersonal relationships, yet most of them may not seek counselling services proactively.The Associate Professor of the Department of Social Work at HKBU and her team have developed an online CBT programme named REST Online to enhance their stress management skills and improve their mental health.CBT is a goal-oriented psychotherapy treatment that helps people cope with life challenges by adjusting their patterns of thinking or behaviour. In addition to online CBT modules, REST Online has invited an experienced counsellor to provide online and offline support to participants.Participants will first be selected through an online screening questionnaire and a face-to-face intake interview. Those who show mild to moderate levels of psychological distress will be invited to participate in the 10-week programme, while high-risk cases will be referred to social service agencies for urgent follow-up.Evidence-based mental health serviceREST Online adopts a blended mode of service delivery including both online and offline counselling. The online service comprises eight weekly online modules, an online forum, reminder, booking, internal messaging and self-evaluation assessments delivered on the programme website or mobile app.The online modules include CBT skills briefing, case demonstration videos, exercise and feedback. The service content is tailored for local tertiary students and delivered in Cantonese, with the case demonstration videos produced from local cases to fit the cultural context of Hong Kong. To evaluate the effectiveness of the programme, participants need to take a test upon completion of the programme, and a follow-up test three months later.The offline counselling is provided by an experienced counsellor, who will provide one face-to-face session plus one telephone follow-up to assist with the online service and review the service progress.Novel approach to meet the needs of tertiary studentsCounselling services on campus are often inadequate to meet tertiary students’ increasing mental health needs, especially in Hong Kong. The REST Online programme will be a valuable supplementary resource for local counsellors in tertiary institutions, helping them to relieve the service bottleneck of insufficient manpower.With young peoples’ strong learning capabilities and conversant skills in information technology, the novel approach of REST Online will be easily accepted by students and it will help address their increasing mental health needs, she added.Besides the Department of Social Work at HKBU, the research team also includes the Associate Head and Professor of the Department of Computer Science at HKBU, as well as the Head of the Clinical Psychology Division in the Department of Psychology at Stockholm University, Sweden.The programme has partnered with the Mental Health Association of Hong Kong and it is supported by a grant from the University Grants Committee.",https://opengovasia.com/we-want-to-upskill-enterprises-ip-capabilities-and-help-businesses-obtain-quicker-and-easier-ip-protection/,http://opengovasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Article_25-Aug-2020_1-HK.jpg

The draft circular includes the requirement that terminal devices of terrestrial mobile communication must be integrated with 4G.The building of the draft draws on lessons from a range of other countries including Singapore, where terminal device manufacturers and suppliers must ensure their support of IMT-2000 technology, which are 3G and LTE-Advanced (4G).Addressing the event, Phan Tam, the Deputy Minister of Information and Communications, explained that technology changes constantly, especially mobile communication. Globally, some countries have deployed 5G, and Vietnam is among the pioneers. Vietnam, agencies, and businesses related to terminal device manufacturing and trading and mobile operations are not exempt from this trend. The government’s goals for national digital transformation cannot be realised on 2G, he noted.The deputy minister asked agencies and businesses to discuss measures and solutions to accelerate the transformation in a way that minimises impacts on businesses and locals. Currently, the draft circular is available for comments on the MIC portal.The trend of online applications has been blossoming, especially in the COVID-19 landscape. Additionally, the government’s Decision No.749/QD-TTg dated 3 June on the approval of the national digital transformation program by 2025 with a vision to 2030 creates the foundation for digital transformation in digital infrastructure development:At present, Vietnam has six mobile telecommunications service providers with over 129 million subscribers. 2G, 3G, and 4G are available, and 5G will be commercialised soon.Addressing the webinar, some mobile telecommunications service providers recommended that it is time to consider turning off 2G, maybe by 2025. 4G will bring about more values but needs time to develop services.

Thailand to roll out free WiFi for select communities			,Article has not blurp,"The Digital Economy and Society (DES) Ministry announced plans to roll out free WiFi services for urban communities, starting with 10 communities from 1 October 2020.CAT Telecom, the state-owned company that runs Thailand’s international telecommunications infrastructure, will be responsible for arranging the services, which will initially target five communities in Bangkok and five in provinces.The The Minister of the DES stated that the ministry aims to give people free internet services to allow them to cope with difficulties doing business and in daily life in the digital era. CAT and the DES Ministry looked at 20 communities for the project, settling on 10 for the first batch. The project does not require much money to install routers, related equipment and platforms linked with CAT’s backbone infrastructure.The National Digital Economy and Society Committee (NDESC), on 30 August 2020, launched the “smart sign-on” programme where people can carry out a one-time registration of the government’s existing free WiFi services through a web portal or In the past, people were required to register repeatedly for access to different WiFi service providers participating in the free public WiFi scheme. After being registered, users will receive their usernames and passwords.The Secretary-General of the NDESC said the approach helps people gain access to free broadband internet services offered by different providers with one set of credentials only. The campaign is a cooperation between CAT, Advanced Info Service, True Corporation and the Office of the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission. Users can type “@TH Wi-Fi by … (internet provider)” and use the same username and password to log in.The system will check the qualifications of the registrants for free WiFi services with the Department Of Provincial Administrative’s database. The first phase of the free public WiFi service was launched in 2017. Approximately 900,000 people have registered under the scheme, consisting of 340,000 people aged up to 21; 390,000 people aged 22-39; 130,000 people aged 40-54 as well as 40,000 people aged 55-99.The aim is to avoid the hassles of using free WiFi that requires multiple registrations through different providers. Users can be assured of internet security when accessing free WiFi services thanks to CAT Telecom guidelines. People can access free public WiFi hotspots in community locations, such as educational institutes, government service facilities and bus stations as well as tourist attractions across the country.According to The Smart Pole setups will be installed near Soi Phon Prapa Nimit, Suthawart Temple Intersection, the Chalerm Phrakiet Intersection, Soi Nern Plubwarn, Soi Marb Yailearb 18/5, the town centre, Boon Sampan Market, Rattanakorn Market, Khao Talo Plaza and adjacent to The Chill.

They can access any information they need, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, as most transactions are online, it will help students quickly and easily share documents and get access to resources, wherever they are.With the blended learning modality in education, free Wi-Fi can also give students access to the world wide web of information and education, the release stated. The Office of the Mayor said that free Wi-Fi is installed in the municipal hall, public schools, rural health units, barangay halls, and other government institutions. According to the 2015 census survey, Hernani has a population of 8,573 people with a poverty incidence of 43.38%. It has 13 barangays where four of them are in the Poblacion.Republic Act 10929 or the Free Wi-Fi Internet Access Program Act requires public places like hospitals, transport terminals, public schools, and other government offices to provide free internet access. Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) Provincial Head, Dante Rosales, said that the city of Borongan and the municipalities of San Policarpo, Oras, Dolores, Can-avid San Julian, Maydolong, and Quinapondan are now enjoying the free Wi-Fi from the said government service provider.As Hernani town is not included, the LGU prioritised the provision of the free Wi-Fi connection.

Vietnam extends 5G network testing licences			,Article has not blurp,"The Telecommunications Department said that the Vietnam Post and Telecommunications Group (VNPT) license to test 5G technology has expired, and it has asked for an extension. The state-run Viettel Group and MobiFone’s licences have been extended until January 2021 and May 2021.According to a According to a report by the Global Mobile Suppliers Association, by the end of May:Currently, the number of announced 5G terminals continues to grow rapidly and is relatively ready for commercial use. Presently, 81 equipment suppliers have announced that the 5G terminals are available or about to be launched, and 283 terminals have been announced. Of these, there are 108 phone models (at least 95 models available in the market), 79 CPE devices (indoors and outdoors), 47 modules, five laptops, 19 hotspots, 20 other devices including three robots, two IoT routers, and two drones. Device suppliers including Huawei, Mediatek, Qualcomm, and Samsung have announced new chipset models for 5G.In Vietnam, according to Viettel’s statistics, the number of 5G terminals is small, with only about 2,000 devices/city in the two major cities of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. To encourage telecommunications businesses to continue 5G network testing and provide commercial testing soon, the Telecommunications Department has requested local IT departments to coordinate with telecom service providers to add their localities into the businesses’ plans for 5G testing.The Telecommunications Department said that due to technical specification, it is impossible to have 5G coverage as large as 4G, so localities need to coordinate with carriers to choose the most suitable places for the trial. This is the basis for MIC to license the 5G network test.The Telecommunications Department has also requested carriers to coordinate with the Department of Information and Communications to deploy the sharing of telecommunications infrastructure. Also, to develop plans for sharing interdisciplinary technical infrastructure (electricity, water, traffic, and urban lighting) as 5G technology requires a much larger number of transmitting stations than previous-generation technologies.According to MIC, telecommunications infrastructure is undergoing an important shift from frequency infrastructure as an economic foundation to important national infrastructure. It is advantageous for the implementation of 5G network in Vietnam because the country’s electronics and telecommunications businesses have actively produced IT infrastructure equipment.Vietnam aims to conduct 5G commercial deployment with 100% of domestic equipment in October 2020.

Instead, all educational institutions shall resume remotely through online platforms, learning management systems, and take-home packets, among others.The Senator also acknowledged the ongoing crisis has laid bare the need to digitise other transactions that used to be handled in person. The Senator, who has been pushing for the transition to e-government platforms, expressed his support for the President’s call to improve the accessibility, efficiency, and transparency of all government services through e-governance.The President during his fifth State of the Nation Address that he aims for all government instrumentalities to implement systems that shall make physical queuing a thing of the past.He noted that the country needs e-governance to provide citizens with the services they need from the comfort of their homes or workplaces. It will enable the bureaucracy to better transition into the ‘new normal’ and cut or minimise red tape.Go filed Senate Bill No. 1738 or the E-Governance Act of 2020 which mandates the establishment of an integrated, interconnected, and interoperable internal government network. This network will allow all branches, agencies, instrumentalities, and offices of the national and local governments, including government-owned and controlled corporations, to share and communicate resources, information, and data.In an age where almost everything can be done online and through other digital platforms, the government must harness the power of information and communications technology to better serve its purpose and bring the government closer to the people, Go added.The proposed measure will likewise create online public service portals, an internal records management system, an email and communications network for internal and intra-government communications, and a national directory of information on Philippine citizens, among others.“We need to evolve- businesses are already transitioning to e-commerce and online transactions. Our education system is also championing blended learning.
