A multi-functioning and well-oiled machine perhaps, but for Singapore-based Michael Gorriz, four main developments are driving transformative change at the banking giant.As group CIO, the award-winning executive is kick-starting an era of innovation at the financial institution, dictated by changing market dynamics and underpinned by a multi-year cloud strategy. “We have taken a very thorough and profound approach to the cloud,” Gorriz told CIO ASEAN. “The first of our four main projects is centred around the harmonisation of our core banking system, in addition to creating a state-of-the-art payment system. We are also focusing on our customer interface within the context of mobile and internet banking, alongside enhancing our connection to corporate customers through APIs and open banking. These are major developments with hefty and solid application blocks which are all designed for the cloud. They can still run on-premises if necessary for regulatory reasons but these versions are made for the cloud and native cloud computing.”Aligned with digital transformation ambitions, Standard Chartered is moving ahead with a multi-cloud approach, ensuring that core banking and trading systems—in addition to virtual banking and banking as-a-service offerings—will be cloud-based by 2025, subject to regulatory approvals.The bank’s multi-year journey to cloud started with software-as-a-service (SaaS) on a large scale, specifically for back-end systems such as financial control and HR. For banking-related software, the business followed the path of infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)—supported by increased levels of security—to build a platform capable of running significant workloads on the cloud.“The banking industry has gone through a massive digital transformation and the recent global pandemic has set the stage for the transformation to accelerate, much faster than ever before,” Gorriz acknowledged. “The bank of the future is here and, if we are to stay in business, cloud adoption is clearly not just a ‘nice to have’. While our journey to be fully on the cloud will be a multi-year journey, I am convinced that cloud technology will be crucial to delivering our network, serving our customers, improving efficiencies and embracing new business opportunities.”",Why embracing the cloud is ‘non-negotiable’ for Standard Chartered,https://www.cio.com/article/3571930/why-embracing-the-cloud-is-non-negotiable-for-standard-chartered.html,2020-09-11

Cloud Computing,"Oracle Analytics for Cloud HCM offers self-service analytics capabilities to HR executives, analysts, and line-of-business leaders.",https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/02/oracle-100833610-large.jpg,"Aiming to help organizations derive insight from workforce analytics, Oracle on Tuesday unveiled Oracle Analytics for Cloud HCM.""Companies have a lot of analytics they want to do about their people and their finances, and typically to do that they've got to move their data left and right, it's not integrated with their processes, it's not integrated with their back-office applications,"" says Bruno Aziza, group vice president of AI and Data Analytics Cloud at Oracle.Oracle Analytics for Cloud HCM is Oracle's answer. Its self-service analytics capabilities are intended to provide HR executives, analysts, and line-of-business leaders with insight into workforce composition, manager performance, span of control, diversity, turnover/retention, comparison ratio analysis, and top talent analysis. The offering, part of the Oracle Analytics for Fusion Applications suite, is intended to work hand-in-glove with Oracle Cloud ERP, giving insight into a broad swathe of back-office functions.""There's a lot of work these HR folks have to do in order to work with our data and we're giving them an out-of-the-box solution that just provides them with pre-packaged content, and it just works with ERP,"" Aziza says.According to research firm Gartner, only 21 percent of HR leaders currently believe their organizations are effective at using talent data to inform business decisions. Gartner says 70 percent of organizations expect to spend more on talent analytics over the next several years.Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, workforce analytics was responsible for about $600 million annually in software spending worldwide, according to research firm IDC.“No doubt annual spending will likely come down for 2020, but we don’t have figures yet,” says Lisa Rowan, research vice president, HR, talent, and learning strategies, at IDC.Currently, most workforce analytics comes from embedded capabilities in human capital management applications themselves. Rowan points to best-of-breed players such as Visier and Qualtrics, as well as embedded capabilities from players such as Workday and Cornerstone.Oracle Analytics for Cloud HCM features a cross-functional data model that sits within the Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse. A KPI and dashboard library offers more than 50 HR KPIs, dashboards, and reports for HR metrics. Some of the pre-built KPIs include:""Imagine the scenario where you have some finance data that tells you've got P&L problems,"" Aziza says. ""The source of that problem is related to your top performers not performing anymore and there's some training that can make them better. The whole workflow can be run though Oracle Analytics, all the way to feeding back into the application and rolling these people into training to get better.""Ultimately, Oracle sees the new offering fostering closer collaboration between HR and other key business units such as finance. While sales and marketing analytics have gotten much of the attention in the past several decades, HR and finance departments need analytic insight just as badly but haven't been well served, Aziza says.""There's a lot of demand in doing analytics in sales, but the business-critical demand, where people are kind of in the dark, is often finance and HR,"" Aziza says. ""That's the oxygen of an organization.""These two areas also have unique data concerns. Employee data, for instance, needs to be kept in a highly secure environment, while finance data must be accurate. The move also underscores Oracle's ongoing focus on its applications’ core domains, which includes financial operations, sales, and HR. Aziza says analytics could also be performed on data generated by non-Oracle applications that run on the Oracle Autonomous Database, integrating and connecting analytics to application workflows.“Integration with other operational applications is critical,” says IDC’s Rowan. “Typically, it is critical that the workforce analytics platform be tightly integrated with the financial system and sales systems. For example, to understand sales performance by salesperson, you need to integrate the analytics tool with the sales tool.”",Oracle takes aim at workforce analytics with new HCM offering,https://www.cio.com/article/3543234/oracle-takes-aim-at-workforce-analytics-with-new-hcm-offering.html,2020-09-11

With a target to move 70 per cent of workloads to the cloud within the next three years, Yosetya supercharged efforts by deploying Anthos to “automate, manage and scale workloads” across “XL Axiata is committed to the modernisation of our infrastructure to get more business agility and increase application deployment velocity,” Yosetya said. “Anthos was a natural fit as it lets us adopt containers while letting Google, a leader in Kubernetes, manage our container infrastructure for us.”AnthosBy migrating its microservices platform to Google Cloud—in addition to bringing Anthos’s Plans are also underway to implement Google Cloud’s data analytics platform to enhance customer experience levels through data and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies.One immediate beneficiary of the increased cloud focus in Indonesia is Amar Bank, evident through the unveiling of the country’s first digital-only bank in Senyumku. Meaning ‘my smile’ in Indonesia’s Bahasa language, the offering will become the first local bank to be deployed via the cloud, with GCP as the host platform.“Senyumku is powered by AI, provides intelligence and nudges users to enable increased savings,” said Vishal Tulsian, president director of Amar Bank. “This requires the app to be highly responsive to the dynamic behaviour of customers. In the future, we plan to extensively use Google Cloud’s AI powered services to provide a micro-customised banking experience to our customers.”The fintech institution—which is majority owned by Singapore-based Tolaram Group —leverages Google Cloud technologies organisation-wide, spanning Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Stackdriver and BigQuery, in addition to big data, AI and machine learning capabilities.“In terms of technology, we are on track to achieve continuous digital transformation to fulfil our customer needs and offer an outstanding customer experience,” Tulsian told CIO ASEAN. “We are committed to supporting financial inclusion in Indonesia through technology as we believe it should bring positive social impact in the society.”Central to such efforts is Tunaiku—meaning ‘my cash’ in Bahasa—which launched as a fintech online leading product aligned to the company’s mantra of “acting like a fintech but thinking like a bank”.“To lead digital transformation, flexibility, scalability and security of the whole IT architecture is of utmost importance,” Tulsian said. “This is possible only through cloud solutions.”In operating as a licensed commercial bank, and as per Indonesian banking regulations, Amar Bank cannot place solutions off-shore or outside of in-country data centres or cloud providers. For Tulsian, the regional launch of GCP now allows the business to capitalise on the local potential of “scalability, security and in-built AI”.“GKE allows us to manage and scale our services easily and in a very cost-effective way,” he explained. “Google Cloud’s data analytics and AI solutions are also scalable and are key to providing a better customer experience solution.”Speaking as chief digital officer of Sequis—a Jakarta-based life insurance specialist—Marlin Sugama acknowledged that irrespective of size or sector, businesses are moving at pace to embrace the cloud across Indonesia. “The cloud has transformed many industry sectors with its ease of deployment, resourcefulness and flexibility, and the insurance industry is no different,” Sugama told CIO ASEAN. “Sequis acknowledges the significance of the cloud and understands the need to adopt it.”In spearheading digital efforts within the business, Sugama said the cloud is widely accepted as the most efficient and effective way for the company, customers and brokers to connect and collaborate on the go. “Sequis is not the only insurance company in Indonesia that acknowledges the significance of the cloud; in fact, the whole insurance industry does,” added Sugama, while also referencing security concerns due to the transactional and financial nature of the industry.Through GCP, Sequis is sharing risk for storage, maintenance and security elements of IT infrastructure, leveraging Google Cloud service-level agreements in the process. In addition to optimising risk, Sugama cited cost efficiencies, access to new technology standards, enhanced IT management and improved scalability as key factors in migrating workloads to the cloud.“GCP offers an environment to adopt the latest digital development trends by offering a new edge of extreme agility, security and resiliency,” he said. “This includes rapid deployment and Similar to Amar Bank, as a financial institution operating in Indonesia, Sequis is bound by the local regulations of Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK), otherwise known as the Financial Services Authority. “Through GCP launching in Indonesia, we have a fully transparent and proactive engagement with the cloud as required by OJK,” Sugama added. “Through this process of collaboration, GCP gives the opportunity for Sequis to move to the cloud in a way that meets the highest compliance, risk and security standards.”",Inside Indonesia’s cloud awakening,https://www.cio.com/article/3563923/inside-indonesia-s-cloud-awakening.html,2020-09-11

Its announcement follows a similar one from Microsoft in September.At the same time, Google is introducing a Premium Support plan to maintain high-availability services, making the GCP more attractive to CIOs averse to down-time.IBM introduced its AS/400 midrange computers in 1988, shipping over half a million units over the next decade.

Putting these into the cloud will allow enterprises to link them with more modern technologies.In Google’s case, that means giving legacy apps private API access to other Google Cloud resources, and allocating private IP addresses to each Power Systems logical partition, all on the same bill as other cloud services.Alongside the Power Systems servers, Google is also introducing a premium 24/7 support plan with 15-minute response time and a cloud API for integration with an enterprise’s own IT support system, for any cloud customer willing to pay the price.

As recently as July 2019, Microsoft executives at the company’s Inspire partner conference estimated that up to Businesses that have stuck with Windows Server 2008 won’t notice the absence of support until February’s Patch Tuesday, as Microsoft released a security update on the last day of support, Jan. 14. The company’s support web pages say it will provide no more patches for the OS, although that’s not strictly true.Microsoft’s server products begin life with “Mainstream Support,” including security and feature updates. For Windows Server 2008, that ended in 2015, with mainstream support for Windows Server 2008 R2 ending the following year.Since then, both versions of Windows Server 2008 have been receiving what Microsoft calls “Extended Support,” which includes only security updates. This gives businesses an extra three years or so to pick the right moment to update to a newer version of Windows Server.Even now, with the end of Extended Support, Windows Server 2008 isn’t dead. Enterprises that want to hold onto the OS for a little longer can sign up for Microsoft’s Extended Security Update Program and receive fixes for another three years — for an annual fee of around 75 percent of the license price.Microsoft describes this option of doing nothing but cutting a check as a “last resort.” After that, it really is the end.There is another way to obtain extended security updates, and that is to move on-premises Amazon Web Services has another idea: Migrate workloads to its cloud instead of Azure, and upgrade to a newer version of Windows at the same time. Its End-of-support Migration Program (EMP) for Windows Server offers a way to decouple applications from the underlying OS, wrapping them in a compatibility layer that redirects calls to APIs that have changed. The software to do that is free, but AWS or its partners will charge a fee to assess and repackage the applications — and, of course, to host them in the AWS cloud.Enterprises moving on-premises workloads to clouds other than Azure will need to examine their paperwork carefully. Last October, Microsoft changed its rules, requiring customers moving on-premises Windows licenses into certain vendors’ clouds to pay additional fees for Software Assurance and mobility rights.Against these cloud and licensing costs, CIOs will have to weigh the benefits of ditching the old, unreliable hardware their applications were running on.Finally, there’s the conventional path to consider: upgrading Windows Server 2008 to a still-supported version.This is a multi-step process, the first of which is to upgrade to Windows Server 2012. Mainstream support for this has already ended, and extended support will run only until 2023.From there, it’s another hop to Windows Server 2016, which benefits from mainstream support until late 2022, and then one last jump to Windows Server 2019 for full support through 2024.Enterprises running the R2 version of Windows Server 2008 can skip a step, moving via 2012 R2 straight to Windows Server 2019.Microsoft’s That’s sound advice whether updating, migrating, extending — or doing nothing: only careful evaluation of an enterprise’s own situation can show the right way to go.",Not dead yet: Windows Server 2008 users have options,https://www.cio.com/article/3514735/not-dead-yet-windows-server-2008-users-have-options.html,2020-09-11

Its capabilities include shared projects, model catalogs, team security policies, reproducibility, and auditability.The platform has the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Science service at its core. It provides users the ability to build, train, and manage machine learning algorithms on the Oracle Cloud using Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Jupyter and other popular data science tools. Six additional services round out the platform, including new machine learning capabilities integrated in Oracle Autonomous Database, the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Catalog, Oracle Big Data Service, Oracle Cloud SQL, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Flow, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Virtual Machines for Data Science.""The service is really the first of its kind in terms of a native cloud service in that it's really targeted for the enterprise,"" says Greg Pavlik, senior vice president product development of Oracle Data and AI Services. ""It is focused on providing an environment for collaboration and governance for data scientists.""According to Pavlik, the offering targets the full lifecycle of machine learning within the enterprise, meaning that it's not just about developing or training models, but also taking those models into production and maintaining them.""As data changes, models become potentially less valid and users need to be able to continue to leverage them inside of applications or inside the analytic reports on the one hand. On the other hand, they have to have a high confidence that what they're using is actually giving them good answers or correct responses,"" Pavlik says.With Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Science, Oracle is taking on platforms from competitors such as Alteryx, KNIME Analytics Platform, and RapidMiner with a focus on automating the data science workflow.The platform leverages AutoML algorithm selection and tuning, using machine learning models to select the best-fit algorithm for a specific use case, and to help users choose algorithm inputs and tune the model, Pavlik says. The platform also simplifies feature engineering by automatically identifying key predictive features from larger data sets.Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Science also aids in model evaluation by generating a suite of metrics and visualizations to help users measure model performance against new data and rank models over time.To support regulatory compliance efforts and help data teams establish trust in the output of their algorithms, Oracle's offering provides automated explanation of the weighting and importance of factors used to generate a prediction.""We have advanced capabilities that we've developed in our Oracle Labs organization for model explainability,"" Pavlik says. ""That's really understanding what is driving the model to its prediction, which is particularly important for regulatory situations where you have to be able to give an accounting of why: Why is the business making this decision? Why is the model telling us to do this?""To support collaboration, Oracle has drawn inspiration from modern software development processes, adding capabilities that support shared projects, model catalogs, team-based security policies, and reproducibility and accountability.""The big problem that we often see with teams is the data scientists are off downloading a bunch of stuff on their laptop and then they're working in relative isolation,” Pavlik says. “You lose some of the sense of accountability, safety, some of the best practices you'd have from software development. So, we're looking to help organizations solve that problem without taking anything away from the data scientist.""The platform enables teams to leverage version control and share data and notebook sessions.

The move introduces a new hosting option for enterprises running modern ERP systems with large databases on the Power platform.That could interest a lot of CIOs: SAP has offered its software on the Power platform since 2005, and ported HANA to the Power architecture in 2015. IBM estimated last year that between 20 percent and 25 percent of HANA workloads then ran on Power, with the rest on servers based on Intel’s architecture.HANA supports scaling for large databases in two ways: scale-up, on a single server with shared memory; or scale-out, on a cluster of smaller servers with shared storage. The latter requires the data to be partitioned, or broken into parts that fit onto the smaller servers.IBM touts its E980 servers — the ones SAP is now hosting — as offering the largest scale-up virtualized server for HANA in the industry, at a whopping 24TB. Some Intel-based instances in Microsoft’s Azure cloud can equal that, though. In addition, several companies (including IBM) offer systems with higher headline capacities, but those are scale-out systems.IBM Power Systems, including its latest processor generation, Power9, are the successors to the fabled AS/400 midrange computers it introduced in 1988. One of Power9’s attractions is that it can still run legacy apps almost unchanged on the IBM i operating system in one logical partition (LPAR) or virtual machine, with another partition running IBM’s AIX flavor of Unix or a Linux distribution such as SUSE Linux Enterprise Server or Red Hat Enterprise Linux.In theory, then, an enterprise could have a single IBM Power Server running SAP HANA on Linux in one LPAR with legacy apps on IBM i in another. That won’t be possible in the HANA Enterprise Cloud, though, as the IBM Power servers there will only run Linux.IBM servers built around IBM’s Power9 processors are also available in the IBM Cloud, on Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure (through Skytap, a company that migrates legacy apps to the cloud), but SAP shops will only be able to host their development environments on those.For production environments, SAP has to certify the cloud, and the only one in which it has certified IBM Power Systems is its own SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud, said IBM Vice President of Offering Management Vicente Moranta.",IBM puts Power Systems in SAP’s cloud,https://www.cio.com/article/3528248/ibm-puts-power-systems-in-saps-cloud.html,2020-09-11

Global spending on the cloud hit $273 billion in 2018 and is poised to exceed an astonishing $623 billion by 2025, according to The reason for cloud's growth is clear: it is often associated with lower costs, greater flexibility, and greater security. But while cloud offers a big boost in physical security beyond what a garden-variety end-user is typically willing or able to afford, it’s still a shared responsibility proposition. Put another way, the provider oversees cloud security, and the customer is in charge of its own security in the cloud – including the integrity of the stored and processed data, and the resilience of all apps and APIs that interface with the web.But most cloud packages include only basic security. If an extra layer of security isn’t added, the customer’s entire IT value chain is basically a line of sitting ducks.

Legacy systems can present roadblocks but as long as this has been achieved, it should be manageable.”RMA started out supplying goods and equipment to the government, non-profit organisations and private contractors in Cambodia and Vietnam during the 1980s. The business soon became known for demonstrating expertise in establishing high quality distribution and service support networks, in addition to helping build infrastructure.Today, core operations centre around automotive retail, manufacturing and parts distribution, fleet management, sales and distribution of heavy equipment, power generation as well as food franchises and engineering services.The company has over 7800 employees, operating in 14 countries, with subsidiaries including RMA Automotive, Global Fleet Sales, Minecorp, Comin Asia and Express Food Group.“From a technology perspective, we usually look for opportunities to make incremental changes,” added Konnaris, in reference to how technology fits into the company’s wider business strategy. “This isn’t always a fit for all projects and technology, but it can significantly help with managing change and staying close to budget.“We also believe that behaviours are generally more important than capabilities, although the ability to learn and adapt is key.”As group CIO, Konnaris holds responsibility for two core technology divisions within RMA: Group IT Operations and Group Business Systems. IT Operations delivers and maintains IT infrastructure such as servers, workstations, telephony, website and application hosting, internet and office suites, while Business Systems provides analysis and ERP solutions.“We measure ourselves in a quantitative way,” he explained. “Metrics are related to service uptime, outstanding issues, cost savings, adherence to budget but ultimately, we are measured by the sentiment of our business customers.”To meet his CEO’s expectations of supporting business growth while maintaining a standard of excellence, Konnaris sees cloud computing as the leading opportunity for CIOs today, complemented by data and artificial intelligence (AI).“The use of cloud services is to reduce risk, increase manageability and scalability,” he said. “Whether on the infrastructure or ERP side, cloud solutions are providing huge benefits in the way that information systems are deployed and managed, allowing more time to gain insights into data and systems, in addition to spending less time creating and/or maintaining data and systems.“In terms of data insights, technology is providing multiple ways to achieve results, with AI being the technology leader right now. AI is the culmination of many layers of analysis involving both humans and technology but the advancements in compute power, analytical templates and the abundance of data storage are making AI a reality for anyone with a data source.”Not everyone sees things the same way, though, and Konnaris says that in Southeast Asia it is common to hear people say that cloud services are less secure than on-premises systems – but always cheaper.“These two challenges are interesting because the former is a perceived negative and the latter is a perceived positive and in reality, they are often the other way around.”For Konnaris, cloud services often have a great deal more infrastructure, monitoring, policies and processes supporting such a strong foundation, whereas legacy systems can represent a compromise and therefore actually cost less.“Different organisations will have a different appetite for security, performance and scalability and the urgency to journey to the cloud might be quite different based on initial perceptions,” he accepted. “Personally, I have taken some time to observe the developments, learn about the new landscapes and try to judge the right time to transform with the least cost and disruption.”For Konnaris, security is something not to be neglected: “We have seen a large increase in cyber-attacks on all levels and we are making great progress with monitoring and detection. This can be attributed to the large increase in compute power, tools and storage, the dark web is providing organised and opportunistic automated attacks.”Since an early age, Konnaris has held a passion for the sciences. While computers featured along the way, the industry executive started his career in the automotive sector, carrying out engine lubricant research and development at Castrol.A switch to core IT soon materialised during the early 2000s, with Konnaris - who joined RMA in September 2006 - drawing on more than 20 years of technology market experience, 15 years of which spent in Bangkok.“My advice to aspiring IT leaders is to be humble and remember that those around us may not have the technical knowledge or experience required to have a clear vision of what we are delivering to them,” he said. “Another is ‘start small, think big’: break everything into small, modular tasks but keep an eye on the big picture.“This is often an advantage with cloud services, especially via ‘pay as you go’ as you can efficiently create a proof of concept before taking developments further.”Looking back on over two decades of IT leadership, Konnaris said that the hardest things in his career have involved starting projects with a blank sheet of paper, tasked with creating a concept from the ground-up.“But I would say that my greatest achievement was developing a low cost ‘branch office’ template that could work anywhere in the world,” he recalled. “This also had to provide a robust and efficient office experience for users, no matter the challenges of the physical location, the level of local IT support or the budget.”Aligned to the philosophy of ‘do the next thing, next’, Konnaris cited virtualisation as the most defining era of his career, a shift in market dynamics which has ultimately triggered the rise of cloud computing.“On its own, virtualisation has greatly reduced the amount of time we spend setting up and configuring hardware and has allowed us to become hardware agnostic,” he said.",‘Single source of truth’ dictates RMA Group’s tech priorities,https://www.cio.com/article/3533253/single-source-of-truth-dictates-rma-group-s-tech-priorities.html,2020-09-11
Cloud Computing,This powerful combo of workload portability and orchestration has become an invaluable business asset in multi-cloud and hybrid cloud environments.,https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/03/tech_spotlight_containers_virtualization_cio_by_kasezo_gettyimages_3x2_2400x1600-100834583-large.jpg,"Companies across industries are pushing to move data and workloads to the cloud, whether as part of digital transformations or to avoid building costly new infrastructure to handle growing demand.For many organizations, key to this move are containers and Kubernetes — especially when multiple cloud services are involved.Containers are standalone software packages that bundle together all of an application’s code and dependencies to ensure the application runs reliably regardless of its computing environment. As such, containers facilitate movement of an application from, for example, a developer's laptop to a test environment, from a test environment to production, or from a physical machine in a data center to a virtual machine in a private or public cloud.But while containers simplify shifting workloads between environments, they still need to be maintained. That’s where Kubernetes comes in. Kubernetes is an open source container-orchestration system designed to automate deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Originally developed by Google, Kubernetes is currently maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.Organizations are discovering that containers and Kubernetes are a powerful combination for enabling workload portability in multi-cloud or hybrid cloud environments. Here are three real-world examples of the technologies in action.Online travel services provider Expedia Group began using microservices architecture and public cloud services from Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2013. But the company accelerated its usage when it started to deploy containers via Amazon EC2 Container Service (ECS) in 2015 to run those microservices and be able to run applications within the AWS cloud environment.The primary business and technology drivers for deploying the technologies included greater portability of applications across multiple environments and accelerated speed to market for new products and services.“With containers spinning up in seconds, the amount of time that is needed to ship a new feature to our customers has significantly reduced, and we are able to accelerate our speed to market,” says Kuldeep Chowhan, distinguished engineer at Vrbo, a unit of Expedia Group that provides lodging services for travelers.The portability of containers between working environments and the speed with which containers can be deployed accelerated the company’s move toward microservices, Chowhan says. Today, thousands of applications are running in production on ECS across multiple AWS cloud regions, enabling Expedia to provide enhanced services for travelers and partners, he says.In 2015, Vrbo adopted Apache Mesos, an open source platform for managing computer clusters, to run container workloads across on-premises data center and AWS cloud environments. That enabled Vrbo developers to run the same workloads in both environments, which in turn accelerated migration from Expedia’s on-premises data center to the cloud, Chowhan says.Expedia also harnessed the power of Kubernetes as the technology gained popularity in recent years. The company’s Hotels.com unit currently runs hundreds of its applications on Kubernetes in the AWS cloud, Chowhan says, helping to provide services such as hotel bookings for customers.And after Amazon launched its Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) in 2019, many teams across Expedia Group, including data science, online experiences, streaming, and others began to leverage it to run container workloads.“Longer term, that is the direction Expedia Group is planning on heading for container runtime and orchestration needs,” Chowhan says.Expedia Group’s shift toward a microservices architecture and containers has provided the company with significant advantages in launching new services quickly. Whereas it used to take months for new application development, it can now churn out new features multiple times a day.“With investments in modernizing our application architecture and DevOps practices, we have seen an order of magnitude increase in features that are shipped to the customers,” Chowhan says. “The Vrbo brand has seen a 12-times increase in release velocity in the last three years.”Thanks to the portability of containers, Expedia applications can be run in a distributed fashion across multiple AWS regions to provide high availability so that customers across the globe can use its travel sites without disruption.Containers also enable “targeted scaling,” Chowhan says. “Earlier when we had a monolith application, we had to scale the entire infrastructure to support the traffic,” he says. “With containers and microservices, now we are able to scale more intelligently the specific parts of our site that have higher customer demand — and realize savings in infrastructure costs.”Containers still require some amount of infrastructure management, Chowhan says: “To be able to deploy and run containers, you need a container runtime and orchestration platform. As with any software solution, there are updates that are released and those updates need to be rolled out to the existing fleet of servers that are running the container platform.”Development processes around containers and microservices have constantly evolved, from source code to runtime, Chowhan says. “We had to retool to be adapt in the new ecosystem across our travel platform, and also train our engineers with the evolving ecosystem across containers,” he says.Finserv and insurance firm Primerica has created a Kubernetes environment to help scale applications in a private cloud offerings from IBM on Nutanix hardware. And containers from Docker help Primerica provide application consistency between environments.“This is a key strategic component in our migration from our traditional technology stack to our modern hybrid cloud,” says Barry Pellas, CTO and executive vice president of application development and delivery at the firm.“This environment allows us to continue to see value out of applications that we have developed over several decades in a new and modern way,” Pellas says. “It also plays a key role in our API [application programming interface] and microservices strategy” by facilitating the delivery of new capabilities to business applications, he says.The container and Kubernetes combination enables Primerica to not only host applications but also to monitor them and recover quickly should anything happen to the containers.“We provide end-to-end infrastructure-as-code, which enables us to consistently build environments that are predictable, and eliminates the possibility of human error,” Pellas says. “Our continuous integration and delivery capabilities ensure that product teams always have the latest changes at their fingertips, and they can feel confident that verification of the environment and application has been done as part of the deployment process itself.”The main drivers for using containers and Kubernetes is to provide teams with an opportunity to deliver applications faster and with better quality, Pellas says. They also provide a secure, stable environment in which to work and scalability during high-use times.“We also wanted the predictability and consistency between our various environments, to help with debugging and problem resolution,” Pellas says.While Primerica has only recently begun to take advantage of containers and Kubernetes, it is seeing increased productivity of teams as well as development of new features for its users that can be delivered in an incremental, agile way.“We have also been able to provide more secure and predictable applications by catching issues early in the development process,” Pellas says. “We hope this will lead to increased quality of our applications and a consistent development experience throughout our product teams, as we migrate more and more applications to the platform.”As with any technology, there is a learning curve for organizations looking to adopt containers and Kubernetes. “Enabling teams with the right skill sets to properly develop within the environment can be challenging,” Pellas says.Primerica is addressing those challenges by providing education to its product teams and best practices for business leaders to get their projects into the pipelines.The Feltus lab in the Department of Genetics and Biochemistry at Clemson UniversityThe lab uses bioinformatics, statistical and In recent years, the lab has focused development efforts on workflows that run on Kubernetes systems. “We believe that Kubernetes will be a common standard platform for data-intensive computing for many years, which allows us to focus our software engineering efforts on one architecture,” Feltus says.Biological databases are growing geometrically, Feltus says, and data sets can be mined for biological insight into some of the largest medical and food security challenges. “Even small biology labs are in constant need of massive computational resources,” he says. “Researchers will soon want to ask biological questions at the petascale [level], which will require access to massive computers that are currently possible in commercial clouds. Kubernetes clusters are an excellent platform to do large scale computing.”Before moving to the cloud, “biological researchers need democratized, credit-free cloud sandboxes where one can engineer and test workflows at scale,” Feltus says. “These sandboxes are critical, since 90 percent of scientific experiments lead to dead ends, which would burn cloud credit budgets before discovery occurs.”The Feltus lab is working with many other research groups to pilot scalable resources that are a blend of on-premises and cloud services, and Kubernetes and containers will play a huge role.“Kubernetes and containers are a go-to platform for computational biology workflow engineering,” Feltus says. “These systems have allowed my students to bypass many of the vagaries of HPC [high-performance computing] environment configuration.”The lab has deployed Cisco Container Platform, which helps the team manage multiple clusters from various cloud providers under one platform.Once the lab has tested its workflows in Kubernetes clusters, it can run the containerized workflows in multiple commercial clouds. “This streamlines end-user training and allows the user to focus on the science,” Feltus says.",Containers and Kubernetes: 3 transformational success stories,https://www.cio.com/article/3530277/containers-and-kubernetes-3-transformational-success-stories.html,2020-09-11

With a target to move 70 per cent of workloads to the cloud within the next three years, Yosetya supercharged efforts by deploying Anthos to “automate, manage and scale workloads” across “XL Axiata is committed to the modernisation of our infrastructure to get more business agility and increase application deployment velocity,” Yosetya said. “Anthos was a natural fit as it lets us adopt containers while letting Google, a leader in Kubernetes, manage our container infrastructure for us.”AnthosBy migrating its microservices platform to Google Cloud—in addition to bringing Anthos’s Plans are also underway to implement Google Cloud’s data analytics platform to enhance customer experience levels through data and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies.One immediate beneficiary of the increased cloud focus in Indonesia is Amar Bank, evident through the unveiling of the country’s first digital-only bank in Senyumku. Meaning ‘my smile’ in Indonesia’s Bahasa language, the offering will become the first local bank to be deployed via the cloud, with GCP as the host platform.“Senyumku is powered by AI, provides intelligence and nudges users to enable increased savings,” said Vishal Tulsian, president director of Amar Bank. “This requires the app to be highly responsive to the dynamic behaviour of customers. In the future, we plan to extensively use Google Cloud’s AI powered services to provide a micro-customised banking experience to our customers.”The fintech institution—which is majority owned by Singapore-based Tolaram Group —leverages Google Cloud technologies organisation-wide, spanning Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Stackdriver and BigQuery, in addition to big data, AI and machine learning capabilities.“In terms of technology, we are on track to achieve continuous digital transformation to fulfil our customer needs and offer an outstanding customer experience,” Tulsian told CIO ASEAN. “We are committed to supporting financial inclusion in Indonesia through technology as we believe it should bring positive social impact in the society.”Central to such efforts is Tunaiku—meaning ‘my cash’ in Bahasa—which launched as a fintech online leading product aligned to the company’s mantra of “acting like a fintech but thinking like a bank”.“To lead digital transformation, flexibility, scalability and security of the whole IT architecture is of utmost importance,” Tulsian said. “This is possible only through cloud solutions.”In operating as a licensed commercial bank, and as per Indonesian banking regulations, Amar Bank cannot place solutions off-shore or outside of in-country data centres or cloud providers. For Tulsian, the regional launch of GCP now allows the business to capitalise on the local potential of “scalability, security and in-built AI”.“GKE allows us to manage and scale our services easily and in a very cost-effective way,” he explained. “Google Cloud’s data analytics and AI solutions are also scalable and are key to providing a better customer experience solution.”Speaking as chief digital officer of Sequis—a Jakarta-based life insurance specialist—Marlin Sugama acknowledged that irrespective of size or sector, businesses are moving at pace to embrace the cloud across Indonesia. “The cloud has transformed many industry sectors with its ease of deployment, resourcefulness and flexibility, and the insurance industry is no different,” Sugama told CIO ASEAN. “Sequis acknowledges the significance of the cloud and understands the need to adopt it.”In spearheading digital efforts within the business, Sugama said the cloud is widely accepted as the most efficient and effective way for the company, customers and brokers to connect and collaborate on the go. “Sequis is not the only insurance company in Indonesia that acknowledges the significance of the cloud; in fact, the whole insurance industry does,” added Sugama, while also referencing security concerns due to the transactional and financial nature of the industry.Through GCP, Sequis is sharing risk for storage, maintenance and security elements of IT infrastructure, leveraging Google Cloud service-level agreements in the process.

Rowan points to best-of-breed players such as Visier and Qualtrics, as well as embedded capabilities from players such as Workday and Cornerstone.Oracle Analytics for Cloud HCM features a cross-functional data model that sits within the Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse. A KPI and dashboard library offers more than 50 HR KPIs, dashboards, and reports for HR metrics. Some of the pre-built KPIs include:""Imagine the scenario where you have some finance data that tells you've got P&L problems,"" Aziza says. ""The source of that problem is related to your top performers not performing anymore and there's some training that can make them better. The whole workflow can be run though Oracle Analytics, all the way to feeding back into the application and rolling these people into training to get better.""Ultimately, Oracle sees the new offering fostering closer collaboration between HR and other key business units such as finance. While sales and marketing analytics have gotten much of the attention in the past several decades, HR and finance departments need analytic insight just as badly but haven't been well served, Aziza says.""There's a lot of demand in doing analytics in sales, but the business-critical demand, where people are kind of in the dark, is often finance and HR,"" Aziza says. ""That's the oxygen of an organization.""These two areas also have unique data concerns. Employee data, for instance, needs to be kept in a highly secure environment, while finance data must be accurate. The move also underscores Oracle's ongoing focus on its applications’ core domains, which includes financial operations, sales, and HR. Aziza says analytics could also be performed on data generated by non-Oracle applications that run on the Oracle Autonomous Database, integrating and connecting analytics to application workflows.“Integration with other operational applications is critical,” says IDC’s Rowan. “Typically, it is critical that the workforce analytics platform be tightly integrated with the financial system and sales systems. For example, to understand sales performance by salesperson, you need to integrate the analytics tool with the sales tool.”",Oracle takes aim at workforce analytics with new HCM offering,https://www.cio.com/article/3543234/oracle-takes-aim-at-workforce-analytics-with-new-hcm-offering.html,2020-09-11

Its capabilities include shared projects, model catalogs, team security policies, reproducibility, and auditability.The platform has the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Science service at its core. It provides users the ability to build, train, and manage machine learning algorithms on the Oracle Cloud using Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Jupyter and other popular data science tools. Six additional services round out the platform, including new machine learning capabilities integrated in Oracle Autonomous Database, the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Catalog, Oracle Big Data Service, Oracle Cloud SQL, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Flow, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Virtual Machines for Data Science.""The service is really the first of its kind in terms of a native cloud service in that it's really targeted for the enterprise,"" says Greg Pavlik, senior vice president product development of Oracle Data and AI Services. ""It is focused on providing an environment for collaboration and governance for data scientists.""According to Pavlik, the offering targets the full lifecycle of machine learning within the enterprise, meaning that it's not just about developing or training models, but also taking those models into production and maintaining them.""As data changes, models become potentially less valid and users need to be able to continue to leverage them inside of applications or inside the analytic reports on the one hand. On the other hand, they have to have a high confidence that what they're using is actually giving them good answers or correct responses,"" Pavlik says.With Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Science, Oracle is taking on platforms from competitors such as Alteryx, KNIME Analytics Platform, and RapidMiner with a focus on automating the data science workflow.The platform leverages AutoML algorithm selection and tuning, using machine learning models to select the best-fit algorithm for a specific use case, and to help users choose algorithm inputs and tune the model, Pavlik says. The platform also simplifies feature engineering by automatically identifying key predictive features from larger data sets.Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Science also aids in model evaluation by generating a suite of metrics and visualizations to help users measure model performance against new data and rank models over time.To support regulatory compliance efforts and help data teams establish trust in the output of their algorithms, Oracle's offering provides automated explanation of the weighting and importance of factors used to generate a prediction.""We have advanced capabilities that we've developed in our Oracle Labs organization for model explainability,"" Pavlik says. ""That's really understanding what is driving the model to its prediction, which is particularly important for regulatory situations where you have to be able to give an accounting of why: Why is the business making this decision? Why is the model telling us to do this?""To support collaboration, Oracle has drawn inspiration from modern software development processes, adding capabilities that support shared projects, model catalogs, team-based security policies, and reproducibility and accountability.""The big problem that we often see with teams is the data scientists are off downloading a bunch of stuff on their laptop and then they're working in relative isolation,” Pavlik says. “You lose some of the sense of accountability, safety, some of the best practices you'd have from software development. So, we're looking to help organizations solve that problem without taking anything away from the data scientist.""The platform enables teams to leverage version control and share data and notebook sessions. Using model catalogs, teams can also share models and the artifacts necessary to modify and deploy them. Team-based security policies provide access controls to models, codes, and data, all integrated with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity and Access Management. Enterprises can also track assets via the platform, thereby ensuring models can be reproduced and audited, even if team members leave.Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Science sits at the core of the new Oracle Cloud Data Science Platform, but Oracle also unveiled six other data and machine learning services to support the platform and integrate it with the company’s overall cloud offering.""If you're working in your notebook, you're doing Python training, it allows you to transparently go out, use compute resources, do scale-out training jobs, without having to drop into an IT administrative type mode.

The move introduces a new hosting option for enterprises running modern ERP systems with large databases on the Power platform.That could interest a lot of CIOs: SAP has offered its software on the Power platform since 2005, and ported HANA to the Power architecture in 2015. IBM estimated last year that between 20 percent and 25 percent of HANA workloads then ran on Power, with the rest on servers based on Intel’s architecture.HANA supports scaling for large databases in two ways: scale-up, on a single server with shared memory; or scale-out, on a cluster of smaller servers with shared storage. The latter requires the data to be partitioned, or broken into parts that fit onto the smaller servers.IBM touts its E980 servers — the ones SAP is now hosting — as offering the largest scale-up virtualized server for HANA in the industry, at a whopping 24TB. Some Intel-based instances in Microsoft’s Azure cloud can equal that, though. In addition, several companies (including IBM) offer systems with higher headline capacities, but those are scale-out systems.IBM Power Systems, including its latest processor generation, Power9, are the successors to the fabled AS/400 midrange computers it introduced in 1988. One of Power9’s attractions is that it can still run legacy apps almost unchanged on the IBM i operating system in one logical partition (LPAR) or virtual machine, with another partition running IBM’s AIX flavor of Unix or a Linux distribution such as SUSE Linux Enterprise Server or Red Hat Enterprise Linux.In theory, then, an enterprise could have a single IBM Power Server running SAP HANA on Linux in one LPAR with legacy apps on IBM i in another. That won’t be possible in the HANA Enterprise Cloud, though, as the IBM Power servers there will only run Linux.IBM servers built around IBM’s Power9 processors are also available in the IBM Cloud, on Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure (through Skytap, a company that migrates legacy apps to the cloud), but SAP shops will only be able to host their development environments on those.For production environments, SAP has to certify the cloud, and the only one in which it has certified IBM Power Systems is its own SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud, said IBM Vice President of Offering Management Vicente Moranta.",IBM puts Power Systems in SAP’s cloud,https://www.cio.com/article/3528248/ibm-puts-power-systems-in-saps-cloud.html,2020-09-11

Global spending on the cloud hit $273 billion in 2018 and is poised to exceed an astonishing $623 billion by 2025, according to The reason for cloud's growth is clear: it is often associated with lower costs, greater flexibility, and greater security. But while cloud offers a big boost in physical security beyond what a garden-variety end-user is typically willing or able to afford, it’s still a shared responsibility proposition. Put another way, the provider oversees cloud security, and the customer is in charge of its own security in the cloud – including the integrity of the stored and processed data, and the resilience of all apps and APIs that interface with the web.But most cloud packages include only basic security.

Cloud Computing,This powerful combo of workload portability and orchestration has become an invaluable business asset in multi-cloud and hybrid cloud environments.,https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/03/tech_spotlight_containers_virtualization_cio_by_kasezo_gettyimages_3x2_2400x1600-100834583-large.jpg,"Companies across industries are pushing to move data and workloads to the cloud, whether as part of digital transformations or to avoid building costly new infrastructure to handle growing demand.For many organizations, key to this move are containers and Kubernetes — especially when multiple cloud services are involved.Containers are standalone software packages that bundle together all of an application’s code and dependencies to ensure the application runs reliably regardless of its computing environment. As such, containers facilitate movement of an application from, for example, a developer's laptop to a test environment, from a test environment to production, or from a physical machine in a data center to a virtual machine in a private or public cloud.But while containers simplify shifting workloads between environments, they still need to be maintained. That’s where Kubernetes comes in. Kubernetes is an open source container-orchestration system designed to automate deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Originally developed by Google, Kubernetes is currently maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.Organizations are discovering that containers and Kubernetes are a powerful combination for enabling workload portability in multi-cloud or hybrid cloud environments. Here are three real-world examples of the technologies in action.Online travel services provider Expedia Group began using microservices architecture and public cloud services from Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2013. But the company accelerated its usage when it started to deploy containers via Amazon EC2 Container Service (ECS) in 2015 to run those microservices and be able to run applications within the AWS cloud environment.The primary business and technology drivers for deploying the technologies included greater portability of applications across multiple environments and accelerated speed to market for new products and services.“With containers spinning up in seconds, the amount of time that is needed to ship a new feature to our customers has significantly reduced, and we are able to accelerate our speed to market,” says Kuldeep Chowhan, distinguished engineer at Vrbo, a unit of Expedia Group that provides lodging services for travelers.The portability of containers between working environments and the speed with which containers can be deployed accelerated the company’s move toward microservices, Chowhan says. Today, thousands of applications are running in production on ECS across multiple AWS cloud regions, enabling Expedia to provide enhanced services for travelers and partners, he says.In 2015, Vrbo adopted Apache Mesos, an open source platform for managing computer clusters, to run container workloads across on-premises data center and AWS cloud environments. That enabled Vrbo developers to run the same workloads in both environments, which in turn accelerated migration from Expedia’s on-premises data center to the cloud, Chowhan says.Expedia also harnessed the power of Kubernetes as the technology gained popularity in recent years. The company’s Hotels.com unit currently runs hundreds of its applications on Kubernetes in the AWS cloud, Chowhan says, helping to provide services such as hotel bookings for customers.And after Amazon launched its Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) in 2019, many teams across Expedia Group, including data science, online experiences, streaming, and others began to leverage it to run container workloads.“Longer term, that is the direction Expedia Group is planning on heading for container runtime and orchestration needs,” Chowhan says.Expedia Group’s shift toward a microservices architecture and containers has provided the company with significant advantages in launching new services quickly. Whereas it used to take months for new application development, it can now churn out new features multiple times a day.“With investments in modernizing our application architecture and DevOps practices, we have seen an order of magnitude increase in features that are shipped to the customers,” Chowhan says. “The Vrbo brand has seen a 12-times increase in release velocity in the last three years.”Thanks to the portability of containers, Expedia applications can be run in a distributed fashion across multiple AWS regions to provide high availability so that customers across the globe can use its travel sites without disruption.Containers also enable “targeted scaling,” Chowhan says. “Earlier when we had a monolith application, we had to scale the entire infrastructure to support the traffic,” he says. “With containers and microservices, now we are able to scale more intelligently the specific parts of our site that have higher customer demand — and realize savings in infrastructure costs.”Containers still require some amount of infrastructure management, Chowhan says: “To be able to deploy and run containers, you need a container runtime and orchestration platform. As with any software solution, there are updates that are released and those updates need to be rolled out to the existing fleet of servers that are running the container platform.”Development processes around containers and microservices have constantly evolved, from source code to runtime, Chowhan says. “We had to retool to be adapt in the new ecosystem across our travel platform, and also train our engineers with the evolving ecosystem across containers,” he says.Finserv and insurance firm Primerica has created a Kubernetes environment to help scale applications in a private cloud offerings from IBM on Nutanix hardware. And containers from Docker help Primerica provide application consistency between environments.“This is a key strategic component in our migration from our traditional technology stack to our modern hybrid cloud,” says Barry Pellas, CTO and executive vice president of application development and delivery at the firm.“This environment allows us to continue to see value out of applications that we have developed over several decades in a new and modern way,” Pellas says. “It also plays a key role in our API [application programming interface] and microservices strategy” by facilitating the delivery of new capabilities to business applications, he says.The container and Kubernetes combination enables Primerica to not only host applications but also to monitor them and recover quickly should anything happen to the containers.“We provide end-to-end infrastructure-as-code, which enables us to consistently build environments that are predictable, and eliminates the possibility of human error,” Pellas says. “Our continuous integration and delivery capabilities ensure that product teams always have the latest changes at their fingertips, and they can feel confident that verification of the environment and application has been done as part of the deployment process itself.”The main drivers for using containers and Kubernetes is to provide teams with an opportunity to deliver applications faster and with better quality, Pellas says. They also provide a secure, stable environment in which to work and scalability during high-use times.“We also wanted the predictability and consistency between our various environments, to help with debugging and problem resolution,” Pellas says.While Primerica has only recently begun to take advantage of containers and Kubernetes, it is seeing increased productivity of teams as well as development of new features for its users that can be delivered in an incremental, agile way.“We have also been able to provide more secure and predictable applications by catching issues early in the development process,” Pellas says. “We hope this will lead to increased quality of our applications and a consistent development experience throughout our product teams, as we migrate more and more applications to the platform.”As with any technology, there is a learning curve for organizations looking to adopt containers and Kubernetes. “Enabling teams with the right skill sets to properly develop within the environment can be challenging,” Pellas says.Primerica is addressing those challenges by providing education to its product teams and best practices for business leaders to get their projects into the pipelines.The Feltus lab in the Department of Genetics and Biochemistry at Clemson UniversityThe lab uses bioinformatics, statistical and In recent years, the lab has focused development efforts on workflows that run on Kubernetes systems. “We believe that Kubernetes will be a common standard platform for data-intensive computing for many years, which allows us to focus our software engineering efforts on one architecture,” Feltus says.Biological databases are growing geometrically, Feltus says, and data sets can be mined for biological insight into some of the largest medical and food security challenges. “Even small biology labs are in constant need of massive computational resources,” he says. “Researchers will soon want to ask biological questions at the petascale [level], which will require access to massive computers that are currently possible in commercial clouds. Kubernetes clusters are an excellent platform to do large scale computing.”Before moving to the cloud, “biological researchers need democratized, credit-free cloud sandboxes where one can engineer and test workflows at scale,” Feltus says. “These sandboxes are critical, since 90 percent of scientific experiments lead to dead ends, which would burn cloud credit budgets before discovery occurs.”The Feltus lab is working with many other research groups to pilot scalable resources that are a blend of on-premises and cloud services, and Kubernetes and containers will play a huge role.“Kubernetes and containers are a go-to platform for computational biology workflow engineering,” Feltus says. “These systems have allowed my students to bypass many of the vagaries of HPC [high-performance computing] environment configuration.”The lab has deployed Cisco Container Platform, which helps the team manage multiple clusters from various cloud providers under one platform.Once the lab has tested its workflows in Kubernetes clusters, it can run the containerized workflows in multiple commercial clouds. “This streamlines end-user training and allows the user to focus on the science,” Feltus says.",Containers and Kubernetes: 3 transformational success stories,https://www.cio.com/article/3530277/containers-and-kubernetes-3-transformational-success-stories.html,2020-09-11
Cloud Computing,"As group CIO of RMA Group, Alex Konnaris is spearheading standardisation efforts at the Bangkok-based global business solutions specialist.",https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/03/alex-konnaris-rma-group-cio-100835796-large.jpg,"Continuing the journey towards the creation of a ‘single source of truth’ is RMA Group’s leading technology priority in 2020, as the global business solutions specialist ramps up its digital transformation efforts.The aggregation of data from multiple systems within the organisation to a single location is part of a widespread standardisation process at the Bangkok-based business, spearheaded by Alex Konnaris as group CIO.Central to such efforts is the introduction of new enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems to better leverage centralised information systems, with the target of reducing the number of manual processes currently in place.“We are largely in the standardisation stage of our digital transformation,” said Konnaris. “Increasing the number and scope of dashboards is also a key priority, allowing senior management to access accurate data and gain insights from automated analysis at their fingertips.”According to Konnaris, however, the standardisation and mapping of business processes should be driven by the organisation as a whole, not the IT department.“Often employees are so busy doing operational tasks that they do not have time or the drive to focus on process standardisation and improvement,” he observed. “Change management must be driven from the top, empowering resources allocation and decision makers.“New systems should fit well in to the ‘start small, think big’ concept, to allow for confidence building, through ‘proof of concept’ before scaling up. Legacy systems can present roadblocks but as long as this has been achieved, it should be manageable.”RMA started out supplying goods and equipment to the government, non-profit organisations and private contractors in Cambodia and Vietnam during the 1980s. The business soon became known for demonstrating expertise in establishing high quality distribution and service support networks, in addition to helping build infrastructure.Today, core operations centre around automotive retail, manufacturing and parts distribution, fleet management, sales and distribution of heavy equipment, power generation as well as food franchises and engineering services.The company has over 7800 employees, operating in 14 countries, with subsidiaries including RMA Automotive, Global Fleet Sales, Minecorp, Comin Asia and Express Food Group.“From a technology perspective, we usually look for opportunities to make incremental changes,” added Konnaris, in reference to how technology fits into the company’s wider business strategy. “This isn’t always a fit for all projects and technology, but it can significantly help with managing change and staying close to budget.“We also believe that behaviours are generally more important than capabilities, although the ability to learn and adapt is key.”As group CIO, Konnaris holds responsibility for two core technology divisions within RMA: Group IT Operations and Group Business Systems. IT Operations delivers and maintains IT infrastructure such as servers, workstations, telephony, website and application hosting, internet and office suites, while Business Systems provides analysis and ERP solutions.“We measure ourselves in a quantitative way,” he explained. “Metrics are related to service uptime, outstanding issues, cost savings, adherence to budget but ultimately, we are measured by the sentiment of our business customers.”To meet his CEO’s expectations of supporting business growth while maintaining a standard of excellence, Konnaris sees cloud computing as the leading opportunity for CIOs today, complemented by data and artificial intelligence (AI).“The use of cloud services is to reduce risk, increase manageability and scalability,” he said. “Whether on the infrastructure or ERP side, cloud solutions are providing huge benefits in the way that information systems are deployed and managed, allowing more time to gain insights into data and systems, in addition to spending less time creating and/or maintaining data and systems.“In terms of data insights, technology is providing multiple ways to achieve results, with AI being the technology leader right now. AI is the culmination of many layers of analysis involving both humans and technology but the advancements in compute power, analytical templates and the abundance of data storage are making AI a reality for anyone with a data source.”Not everyone sees things the same way, though, and Konnaris says that in Southeast Asia it is common to hear people say that cloud services are less secure than on-premises systems – but always cheaper.“These two challenges are interesting because the former is a perceived negative and the latter is a perceived positive and in reality, they are often the other way around.”For Konnaris, cloud services often have a great deal more infrastructure, monitoring, policies and processes supporting such a strong foundation, whereas legacy systems can represent a compromise and therefore actually cost less.“Different organisations will have a different appetite for security, performance and scalability and the urgency to journey to the cloud might be quite different based on initial perceptions,” he accepted. “Personally, I have taken some time to observe the developments, learn about the new landscapes and try to judge the right time to transform with the least cost and disruption.”For Konnaris, security is something not to be neglected: “We have seen a large increase in cyber-attacks on all levels and we are making great progress with monitoring and detection. This can be attributed to the large increase in compute power, tools and storage, the dark web is providing organised and opportunistic automated attacks.”Since an early age, Konnaris has held a passion for the sciences. While computers featured along the way, the industry executive started his career in the automotive sector, carrying out engine lubricant research and development at Castrol.A switch to core IT soon materialised during the early 2000s, with Konnaris - who joined RMA in September 2006 - drawing on more than 20 years of technology market experience, 15 years of which spent in Bangkok.“My advice to aspiring IT leaders is to be humble and remember that those around us may not have the technical knowledge or experience required to have a clear vision of what we are delivering to them,” he said. “Another is ‘start small, think big’: break everything into small, modular tasks but keep an eye on the big picture.“This is often an advantage with cloud services, especially via ‘pay as you go’ as you can efficiently create a proof of concept before taking developments further.”Looking back on over two decades of IT leadership, Konnaris said that the hardest things in his career have involved starting projects with a blank sheet of paper, tasked with creating a concept from the ground-up.“But I would say that my greatest achievement was developing a low cost ‘branch office’ template that could work anywhere in the world,” he recalled. “This also had to provide a robust and efficient office experience for users, no matter the challenges of the physical location, the level of local IT support or the budget.”Aligned to the philosophy of ‘do the next thing, next’, Konnaris cited virtualisation as the most defining era of his career, a shift in market dynamics which has ultimately triggered the rise of cloud computing.“On its own, virtualisation has greatly reduced the amount of time we spend setting up and configuring hardware and has allowed us to become hardware agnostic,” he said.",‘Single source of truth’ dictates RMA Group’s tech priorities,https://www.cio.com/article/3533253/single-source-of-truth-dictates-rma-group-s-tech-priorities.html,2020-09-11

Its announcement follows a similar one from Microsoft in September.At the same time, Google is introducing a Premium Support plan to maintain high-availability services, making the GCP more attractive to CIOs averse to down-time.IBM introduced its AS/400 midrange computers in 1988, shipping over half a million units over the next decade. They were succeeded by the iSeries server and later the Power Systems range, while the operating system they ran, OS/400, has been replaced by IBM i. Today’s systems can — and sometimes do — still run much of the same software.Vormittag Associates Inc. (VAI), a developer of enterprise management software in Ronkonkoma, N.Y., still targets the platform and is one of the companies, along with its customers, that stands to benefit from Google’s and Microsoft’s moves.Its software now runs on IBM i but “it goes back to the heritage of System i and iSeries, and way back to the AS/400 days,” says VAI’s CIO Kevin Beasley. “Now Google hosts IBM i, IBM hosts it, Microsoft hosts it. … Back when we started there weren't many places that you could actually find IBM i hosted.”Thousands of other companies are still running systems built on the old AS/400 architecture, according to all400s.com, a website that tracks job offerings for IT workers with AS/400 skills, prompting the cloud giants to look for ways to serve these businesses.Microsoft introduced IBM Power9 instancesThis week Google took the wraps off a fuller offering, now also able to run Linux on IBM Power and the successor to the AS/400, IBM i.Among the applications that run on IBM i are SAP, Oracle and IBM’s own DB2 database. Putting these into the cloud will allow enterprises to link them with more modern technologies.In Google’s case, that means giving legacy apps private API access to other Google Cloud resources, and allocating private IP addresses to each Power Systems logical partition, all on the same bill as other cloud services.Alongside the Power Systems servers, Google is also introducing a premium 24/7 support plan with 15-minute response time and a cloud API for integration with an enterprise’s own IT support system, for any cloud customer willing to pay the price.

But CIOs have options beyond updating to a more recent iteration of Windows server, including staying put or migrating to the cloud.If you still have workloads running on Windows Server 2008, you’re not alone. As recently as July 2019, Microsoft executives at the company’s Inspire partner conference estimated that up to Businesses that have stuck with Windows Server 2008 won’t notice the absence of support until February’s Patch Tuesday, as Microsoft released a security update on the last day of support, Jan. 14. The company’s support web pages say it will provide no more patches for the OS, although that’s not strictly true.Microsoft’s server products begin life with “Mainstream Support,” including security and feature updates. For Windows Server 2008, that ended in 2015, with mainstream support for Windows Server 2008 R2 ending the following year.Since then, both versions of Windows Server 2008 have been receiving what Microsoft calls “Extended Support,” which includes only security updates. This gives businesses an extra three years or so to pick the right moment to update to a newer version of Windows Server.Even now, with the end of Extended Support, Windows Server 2008 isn’t dead. Enterprises that want to hold onto the OS for a little longer can sign up for Microsoft’s Extended Security Update Program and receive fixes for another three years — for an annual fee of around 75 percent of the license price.Microsoft describes this option of doing nothing but cutting a check as a “last resort.” After that, it really is the end.There is another way to obtain extended security updates, and that is to move on-premises Amazon Web Services has another idea: Migrate workloads to its cloud instead of Azure, and upgrade to a newer version of Windows at the same time. Its End-of-support Migration Program (EMP) for Windows Server offers a way to decouple applications from the underlying OS, wrapping them in a compatibility layer that redirects calls to APIs that have changed. The software to do that is free, but AWS or its partners will charge a fee to assess and repackage the applications — and, of course, to host them in the AWS cloud.Enterprises moving on-premises workloads to clouds other than Azure will need to examine their paperwork carefully. Last October, Microsoft changed its rules, requiring customers moving on-premises Windows licenses into certain vendors’ clouds to pay additional fees for Software Assurance and mobility rights.Against these cloud and licensing costs, CIOs will have to weigh the benefits of ditching the old, unreliable hardware their applications were running on.Finally, there’s the conventional path to consider: upgrading Windows Server 2008 to a still-supported version.This is a multi-step process, the first of which is to upgrade to Windows Server 2012. Mainstream support for this has already ended, and extended support will run only until 2023.From there, it’s another hop to Windows Server 2016, which benefits from mainstream support until late 2022, and then one last jump to Windows Server 2019 for full support through 2024.Enterprises running the R2 version of Windows Server 2008 can skip a step, moving via 2012 R2 straight to Windows Server 2019.Microsoft’s That’s sound advice whether updating, migrating, extending — or doing nothing: only careful evaluation of an enterprise’s own situation can show the right way to go.",Not dead yet: Windows Server 2008 users have options,https://www.cio.com/article/3514735/not-dead-yet-windows-server-2008-users-have-options.html,2020-09-11
